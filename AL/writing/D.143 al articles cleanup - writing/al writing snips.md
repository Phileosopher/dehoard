Whether you're writing a report, a letter, or a presentation, ask yourself:
- Who's the audience?
- What are they looking for?
- How much detail do they want or need?
- How will the information I have help them in going forward?
- How much background information do they need?
- Is anyone likely to be hostile toward what I have to say?
- Are they familiar with industry jargons?
- What kinds of examples and analogies will be most helpful to them?

Which ad would catch your attention? "Loaded with fiber and vitamins" or "will lower your blood pressure, cholesterol level, and help prevent a stroke"?
Don't just tell people the benefits - show them how it will benefit their lives.
BAD: "This car has antilock brakes and passenger-side airbag." GOOD: "This car will save your life."
BAD: "We will prepare your taxes and send them to you, ready to sign." GOOD: "Our customer's tax refunds are 25% higher than the average."
BAD: "You will be working on a cross-departmental team." GOOD: "You'll be increasing your visibility in the company and working with people who can jump-start your career."
BAD: "This speaker specializes in leadership." GOOD: "The last guy who hired this speaker said, 'He made me look like a hero and inspired my people to raise our profits by 80%.'"

MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS THE MAP
As if you're driving to the same destination in different cars, if everyone has the map, you don't need to wait for the slowest one.
The it doesn't matter if you get separated, you all end up in the same destination.

GOOD ENOUGH
Don't let unhealthy perfectionism keep you from cutting to the chase. Know when to let things go.
Will anyone but me appreciate my efforts?
Can I significantly improve this if I keep working?
Does the possible gain in quality outweigh the lost time?

Use conventions so people don't have to think for even a millisecond.

Aim for self-evident first.
If that fails, self-explanatory should be 2nd best.
Try to not need to explain at all.

Omit needless words. Avoid happy-talk and instructions.
