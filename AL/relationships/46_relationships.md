Put Forth Effort In Your Relationship
People tend to think all romantic interaction should be spontaneous. If that is your theory and you are going to get married, you might as well just give up right now. When you are married, especially when you have little kids and you both have a job, you are so busy that the probability you are going to find time for spontaneous mutual interaction decreases to zero. So if that is what you are hoping for, then you are never going to have it. What you have to do is make time for each other. 
When you are dating and establishing the relationship, you put effort into it. You go out for dinner, you dress up to some degree, and you try to present yourself in an acceptable manner. Then, you hope there is going to be a positive consequence, and you are going to find each other attractive. But people somehow think that once they are married, the same amount of effort is not necessary â€” and that is wrong. In fact, more effort is necessary on the same front. You have to think it through. 
My rule of thumb regarding how much time to spend together each week for the sake of the intimate element of your relationship is derived from clinical observations: You need to spend 90 minutes talking with your partner each week. That means telling each other about your lives, staying in touch so that you each know what the other is up to, discussing what needs to be done to keep the household running smoothly, and laying out some mutually acceptable vision of how the next week or the next months are going to go. 

Archive Conversations
Sometimes we get impatient when we eagerly wait for someone to respond to a message. To help with patience, try archiving the conversation after your last unanswered question. This will help prevent you from being reminded about the lack of response whenever you open the app. Out of sight, out of mind.

Be Positive
Sometimes dating can be frustrated. When you meet someone new, try to make your introductions and descriptions positive. With the sheer number of options people are faced with these days, they won't want to spend time on someone who doesn't seem like they're going to bring happiness into their life right off the bat.

It's only a problem if you make it a problem
Frequently people will lament or worry about traits or habits about themselves that they feel someone else may not like. Weight, height, etc. If the person you're interested in doesn't mention it as an issue, then you shouldn't either. You'll only end up putting a negative opinion into their head when in fact they may have never been thinking about it in the first place.

Patience
People have lives. When someone returns to a conversation, the last thing they'll want is to be greeted by a wall of self-doubting neuroticism when they had no mal-intentions. Remember, try to always be positive.

Facts vs Feelings
Win the fight, lose the relationship
Try to remind yourself about your bigger goal when you're fighting. The point isn't to win the argument, the point is to make the relationship succeed. The best way to accomplish this is to remind yourself what you really want in the relationship, and not just how you feel at that exact moment. Try to deliberately lose the fight as quickly as possible and you'll find both you and your partner will be able to resolve things more easily.

number one indicator of divorce:
- they're calmly speaking with each other, but they're tense (i.e., they're speaking to self-protect, NOT to build any sort of relationship)
