## Done For Now

A few courses I haven't taken:
- Dr. John Gottman's The Art and Science of Love (https://www.gottman.com/product/the-art-and-science-of-love-online/). I saw the following and wish to honor it, though I already paid for the course:
  - The Art & Science of Love Online course and manual are provided for general educational purposes only. If you or a family member are experiencing personal or family problems such as physical or sexual abuse, active alcoholism, or drug addiction, child abuse, mental illness, or serious depression, especially if suicide is a concern, we urge you to seek professional treatment immediately and only consider using this online workshop and manual with the consultation and support of a trained mental health professional.
  - I'd be happy to explore it once it gets approved by a psychological professional.
- Spark My Relationship (https://sparkmyrelationship.com/) from something similar:
  - The course is not suitable if there is violence, abuse or infidelity in your relationship, or a recent history of such occurrences. Such issues require more direct assistance from a professional than what our course is able to provide.
