The key to cherishing is to STOP COMPARING
- don't compare her actions to yours
- don't compare her to other women

It's not just a matter of loving her, but about enjoying her

Let our actions as well as our words show her/him that they are loved, respected and cared for.

MENTAL
Allow your wife to set your standard of beauty, and make it clear to her that she is secure. Your eyes are only for her. Security breeds confidence.

THE PAST
Acknowledge past hurts and forgive them

SHOWING SUPPORT
Surprise your partner by filling up their gas tank
Take care of the kids for a day so that she can have a personal spiritual retreat to recharge.
Help them
Be sensitive to their needs
Clean or organize something of yours she finds messy
Be an advocate for her rest. Gently help her to evaluate and set limits on her to-do list, reminding her that she loves others best when she takes time to replenish.
Be careful and considerate in our language.  Learn to give and receive feedback in a way that empowers your partner and your relationship. 
Acknowledge each other's feelings and the "stories" we tell ourselves without having to defend.
Accept your partner's limitations without comparing them to others and making them feel ashamed for where they may fall short.  You might need to do a "relationship reckoning" which means:  do the things my spouse provide me outweigh the things they don't?  If the answer is no - then you might need to walk away.  If the answer is yes - then you will likely need to grieve what you are missing and do so in a way that does not involve shaming our partner.  

CONFLICTS
When she messes up, respond with the kind of grace, compassion and mercy that God gives us.  Respond in a way that communicates, “You’re safe with me and I’m not going to rehash your failures. This is a secure place for you to grow and I love the journey with you.”

MAINTENANCE
Put effort into developing feelings of closeness
- ask what closeness looks like to her, then try to reproduce those conditions
Meet with your partner for a check-in at the end of the year
Ask important questions and talk about hard topics
Help your partner prioritize rest and self-care
Ask your partner how they feel most cherished
Gently protect her. Lovingly help her set boundaries with her time, energy, resources, and relationships (kids and mothers-in-law included).

PAMPERING/GENEROSITY
Plan out a spa day for her
Plan out a cute Valentine’s Day surprise
Bring your spouse a cup of coffee (or tea) in bed
Learn about your partner’s love language
When in doubt, work on spending quality time together
Make a playlist with songs that specifically encourage things you love about her.

SIGNALING
Remind yourself that you and your partner are on the same team
Let your partner know you’re putting in a conscious effort
Talk to your partner about meeting their emotional need
Remind your partner how much you value them on a daily basis
Leave your partner a love note where they’d least expect it
Send them a random text telling them you love them
Public display of affection
    Post on her Facebook wall: “I love being your husband. You still take my breath away.”
    Have your children write her notes or letters about what they love about her as a mom.
    Remind her of the amazing impact she has on other people and give specific examples.
Take updates
Compliment them
Do not try to change them
Cherish her by sending a text or email, “Praying for you today. Thanks for being so courageous in ________.”
Tell her areas she’s gifted in. Don’t stretch the truth: Be honest so she can trust you.

EXCLUSIVITY
Pay attention when the other is talking.  No distractions.  Eye contact is affirming and shows loving respect and consideration.  Let's have technology free time every day in order to make real time for real connection.  
Make them feel heard: listen to her sincerely

RECOLLECTING
Take out your photo album and reminisce about your wedding day
Remember how much the little things matter

OPENNESS
Talk through your budget together. Make sure you both have the resources you need to care for your family well. Esteem the wise financial decisions she makes.  This definitely shows you cherish her.
Make eye contact with them when they’re talking to you
Remember the power of physical touch in a relationship
Respect your differences
Talk about her fears – both deep and small. Overtime, lead her as you work together to replace those fears with faith in God as expressed in His Word.

PHYSICAL
Be a student of her body. Ask her, both while you’re in bed and at a completely separate private time, how you can please her sexually and make her feel secure and beautiful.
Give her a massage – one that doesn’t lead to sex, unless she’s clear that making love is what she would enjoy most.

DATING
Choose an activity and time for a date night
Be proactive about doing something together that she enjoys. Make a date, get her excited and share her enthusiasm!
Play together: Paintball, laser tag, sand volleyball. Have a picnic, go to the drive-in…
