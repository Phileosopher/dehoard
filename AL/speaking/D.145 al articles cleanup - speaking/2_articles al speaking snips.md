## Art of Communication
Don't make important decisions alone
Don't cut communication, don't go away, don't flee
When you communicate a hard decision, don't hide behind emails, talk directly to your audience
Use the [SBI tool](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/situation-behavior-impact-feedback.htm) (Situation - Behavior - Impact)
Assertiveness is ability to say yes to the person, no to the task
:star: Prepare, verify carefully what you will communicate
Check if your message has been heard and understood
Expect / Give feedback
Set the main idea first
Avoid passive constructions
Be open minded, don't think you know everything about your audience
Use the body language (physical and visual contact, ...)
Stay calm : Wrap up then stop talking. Pause. Repeat. Ask clarification of a statement. Be clear.
Look for humor.
Look for compromise if the other cares about something not important for you
Agree to disagree : take beak so everyone calms down
Assert yourself : express (negative) opinions and needs positively. Ask for help. Learn from errors. Accept feedback. Say no
Observe rather than interpret. Communicate facts not interpretations
Understand people's needs/feelings
Use non violent communication

## Art of Questions
Just ask
Explain your misunderstanding
Explain / state what you know / don't know
Sound confident
Have a come back
Know first which answer type you're expecting : Opinion ? Factually correct answer ? Well reasoned judgment ?
Avoid "yes" or "no" questions
Dig deeper (5 Why...)
Use the power of silence
Don't interrupt
Prepare the topic (know a bit what you are talking about)
Check your assumptions (are you sure about what you think you know ?)
Find the right person to ask
Use correct grammar
Keep the question simple
Differentiate between open (Why ?) vs closed (when ? who ?) question types
Explain why you are asking
