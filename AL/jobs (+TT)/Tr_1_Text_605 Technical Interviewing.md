1. Prepare for technical questions: There are a lot of articles online and videos on YouTube to help you with the technical questions.
2. General interview preparation: Don't forget to prepare for more general interview questions like "tell me about yourself?".
3. Mock interviews: I know from experience that mock interviews are crucial. Preparing on paper is completely different from actually answering questions in person. Practice and practice some more!
4. Don't underestimate/undervalue yourself. For me this is the most important advice I can give someone. I battle with this on a daily basis. My biggest barrier isn't my skills, it's my lack of confidence. Remember, you know more than you think. Don't talk yourself down, be positive about what you can do and what you have achieved.

While it is true that you can cycle through common data structures in your head when stuck on a problem, and that hashmaps are commonly part of the solution, don't just pull a hashmap out of nowhere. One of my first coding interviews ever went something like this:

Interviewer: I'd like you to produce a compressed string. For example, you may turn aaaabbc into a4b2c1. You may turn a into a1
Me: _immediately starts coding_ Let's use a hashmap
Interviewer: Uh…well do you think you..
Me: Okay, so we've made a hashmap. Now let's make a bunch of print statements

A hashmap is a useful tool, especially in these, but this isn't an RPG. You don't just immediately summon a hashmap and then crush every interview until you finally encounter the boss who can counter hashmaps ("oh no, guess I'd better bust out my ultimate move: The linked list!").

In some leetcode-esque problems, you can get away with using an array instead of a hashmap (and you can use size 26 by subtracting 'a'). Don't rely on that for everything. Some of the simplest interview problems involve using a hashmap to take counts, and then going from there…you can't just use a really big array without raising eyebrows.

It helps to know some useful calls, like std::sort or whatever the heck the equivalent is in other languages
The best interviewing experiences are like pair programming, where the two of you actually seem to be bouncing ideas off of each other. The worst interviews just involve the other person silently judging you

What exactly happens to pass the interview can vary from
region to region. For example, many silicon-valley-esque companies
prefer asking data structures and algorithms questions, so if you plan
on applying to those types of companies having a strong foundation in
that topic is a must. This may not necessarily be the case in other
parts of the world or for other kinds of companies.

Some common interview archetypes you may run into include:

- Giving you a coding challenge of some kind, usually about data
    structures and algorithms - especially at the entry level. To learn
    more about what these types of interviews look like and how to prepare
    for them, consider purchasing or borrowing a copy of "Cracking the
    Coding Interview".
- Asking you questions related to the specific role you're interviewing for - e.g. frontend web design, security, data science…
- Asking you to pair program together with your interviewer where you collaboratively build or debug a small program
- Asking you to complete a take-home challenge of some kind
- Asking you to try designing the high-level architecture of some larger program
- Asking you about items you have listed on your resume (sometimes in general, sometimes focusing on a single project in-depth)
- Just having a discussion about technology in general

Note: this is not an exhaustive list. You should also keep in mind
that different employers will look for different things and interviewing
practices that are common in one area may be almost completely unheard
of in another. So, we strongly recommend you network with developers in
your local area and ask them for advice.
