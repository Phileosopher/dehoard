- YOU MAY BE STUCK DOING ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING!

Every individual is unavoidably an investor, too. When you choose a career, you act on your belief that the kind of work you do will be valuable decades from now.

Life is not a portfolio. Any individual cannot "diversify" herself by keeping dozens of equally possible careers in ready reserve.

Our schools teach the opposite: "It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you do it well." That is completely false. It does matter what you do. You should focus relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before that you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.
