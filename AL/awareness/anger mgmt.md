types of anger
    passive anger - can express as procrastination, sulking or avoidance
    aggressive anger - can express as physical outbursts, bullying, even violence
    assertive anger - stands up for rights without infringing others' rights

anger physiology
    1 adrenaline release increases
    2 heart rate and blood pressure rise
    3 muscles tighten and prepare the body for a "fight or flight" reaction

mindfulness helps with anger management
    increases emotional awareness
    breaks reactive patterns
    reduced rumination
    stress reduction

mindfulness has some components
    non-judgment
    acceptance
    non-attachment
    compassion

anger is connected to suffering
    we must understand the source of our suffering
    we must manage our expectations
    frequent anger can have a negative effect on our mental and physical health
    identify the relationship between anger and suffering to face it with awareness, NOT to suppress it

we must find the anger triggers
common triggers
    perceived disrespect
    unmet needs
    frustration over blocked goals
    unfair treatment
    past traumas

mindfulness can help identify triggers
    helps slow down reactions
    creates distance from our own experiences
    it helps to log the events as they arise

the emotional response cycle:
    1. stimulus - i.e., triggers
    2. initial reaction - could be a tightening in the chest, adrenaline rush, or a fleeting thought
    3. interpretation - our brain's effort to understand the situation and make sense of it
    4. full emotional experience - the moment we feel the entire emotion
    5. action or expression - how we show the emotion externally
    6. resolution or suppression - either we resolve and release the emotion, or suppress it for it to potentially resurface later

several factors influence our emotional responses
    personal history
    current mental state
    physical state
    environmental factors and context

mindfulness in decoding emotional responses
    pause and observe - pay attention to your body's signals
    non-judgmental awareness - avoid using labels on feelings as "good" or "bad"
    body scan - pay attention to specific parts of the body
    journaling - keeping a record of how our emotional responses move around our body

cognitive distortions can disrupt self-awareness
    overgeneralization - drawing broad conclusions from a single event
    catastrophizing - expecting the worst-case scenario
    personalization - believing things are exclusively your fault, even when they're not
    black-and-white thinking - seeing things in absolute good/bad terms
    mind reading - assuming you know what others are thinking without concrete evidence
    rumination - repeatedly thinking about distressing events or feelings, which can amplify anger

challenge cognitive distortions with further awareness
    awareness of thoughts - know precisely what you're thinking
        NOTE: CBT is helpful here
    non-identification - understand you are not your thoughts
    curiosity - ask if a thought is accurate or helpful
    grounding techniques - come back to the present moment (e.g., focusing on your breath, engaging your senses)

self-awareness does several things
    detects early signs of risks
    decodes emerging patterns
    gives us freedom to choose our reactions instead of acting on impulse

self-awareness techniques
    body scan meditation - paying attention to different parts of the body
    journaling - reflecting on the feelings involved
    mindful check-ins - ask how you're feeling at the moment
    observe thoughts - spend a few minutes each day observing thoughts without judgment
how to do it
    start with a single technique and practice it regularly
    use reminders (e.g., alarms) to routinely check in
    dedicate a specific time each day for journaling
    engage in group mindfulness discussions

breathing is directly connected to anger
    breathing can become rapid and shallow
    heart rate often increases
    the body may go into "fight or flight" mode
types of breathing
    diaphragmatic breathing - slow, deep breaths that fill the deepest part of your lungs
        stimulates the vagus nerve, which promotes relaxation
    counted breathing - take a deep breath while counting to 4, hold for 4 counts, release across 4 counts
        gives an anchoring that focuses away from the world around us
    observational breathing - sit or lie comfortably with one hand on the stomach and one on the chest, then feel the breathing as you go
breath awareness has immediate benefits
    immediate calm
    distracts from triggers
    physiologically regulates us
incorporating breath awareness
    regularly practice it
    use it as a first response
    pair it with other mindfulness techniques

mindful walking is walking without a destination in mind, for the sole purpose of walking
    grounds you
    gives a physical release
    creates a connection with nature
how to mindfully walk
    start walking slower than usual, feel your feet interacting with the ground
    synchronize your breath
    keep eyes open and relaxed with gaze directed about 6 feet in front
    find a comfortable position for your hands
    finish in stillness

we're constantly bombarded with thoughts, and most of them are unnoticed
mindfulness helps us to step back and evaluate the situation, and it has several benefits:
    Detachment - view our feelings like they're passing through instead of as concrete truths
    Clarity - we can understand fact-based concepts
    Choice - we can pick the best way to respond to our thoughts

techniques to mindfully observe thoughts
    mindful breathing with thought observation - observe thoughts as they flow through and simply label them as "thinking" or "jduging"
    journaling - jot down dominant thoughts
    questioning thoughts - gently question negative and anger-inducing thoughts
challenges in thought observation
    over-identification with thoughts - believing our identity comes through our thoughts
    resistance - trying to push away or alter negative thoughts instead of plainly observing them
    overwhelm - inundated by the sheer volume or intensity of thoughts
we can also have cognitive distortions
    overgeneralization - believing one negative event is part of a never-ending pattern of defeat
    catastrophizing - assuming the worst possible outcome in a given situation
    black and white thinking - viewing situations in absolute "good" or "bad" terms, with no middle ground
mindfulness shows distortions, which opens up the possibility for cognitive restructuring
    highlights distortions - helps us recognize and pause before reacting
    promotes objectivity - lets us see things as they truly are, not how the distortions portray them
    encourages flexibility - helps challenge and change rigid beliefs that drive anger
Steps for mindful cognitive restructuring
    1. awareness - mindfulness, without judgment
    2. identification - label the cognitive distortion (e.g., "overgeneralization")
    3. questioning - challenge the validity of the thought
    4. reframing - replace the distorted thought with a more balanced and realistic one
mindful cognitive restructuring has benefits
    reduced reactivity
    increased emotional intelligence
    enhanced problem-solving

rumination involves replaying situations, conversations, or events, which often lead to a cycle of escalating negative feelings
the impact of rumination
    prolonged emotional stress - magnifies the scope of the pain from the event
    reduced problem-solving capacity - often obsesses about the problem
    risk of mental health issues - can lead to anxiety, depression, and prolonged periods of distress
mindfulness counterbalances the obsession with the past by focusing on the present
    awareness is cultivated - we become more conscious of when we're ruminating
    distancing from thoughts - we recognize that thoughts are transient interpretations of reality, and learn to not identify with every thought
    grounding in the present - techniques like breath awareness bring us back to the present
strategies to overcome rumination with mindfulness
    mindful breathing - paying attention to your breathing
    labeling thoughts - label ruminative thoughts as "rumination" or "past thinking"
    mindful distraction - engage in a mindful activity that captures your attention like mindful walking, listening to sounds, or kneading dough
    mindful reflection - allocate a specific time of the day for reflection

reframing is essential
    it reduces emotional reactivity
    it enhances our capacity for empathy
    it promotes problem-solving
to reframe, you must be aware of your initial perspective
    1. question the initial narrative - look at other ways to interpret the situation
    2. visualize alternatives - try to "see" the situation from a different angle
    3. ground yourself in reality - focus on facts and try to separate them from interpretations
    4. choose a constructive response - it could be seeking clarification, expressing feelings calmly, or even choosing to let go of the situation
reframing doesn't mean dismissing your feelings or giving the benefit of the doubt
    it's about granting yourself peace from gaining flexibility in thought

the stress-anger nexus
    stress and anger often work together
    recognizing the relationship between the emotions helps us address where our reactive patterns come from
benefits of reducing stress through mindfulness
    improved physical health
    enhanced emotional balance
    increased clarity and focus
mindful techniques for stress reduction
    body scan meditation - scan top to bottom every part of your body, without judgment
    guided imagery - take a "mental vacation" by imagining yourself somewhere
    mindful eating - focusing on the act of eating: the taste, texture, and aroma
    progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) - sequentially relax each muscle in your body
daily mindfulness routines
    mindful walking - walking while paying close attention to the environment and self
    mindful breathing - paying attention to oneself
    mindful listening - pay close attention to someone, without judgment

emotional regulation techniques
    emotions are natural and healthy, but they can be intense enough and unpredictable enough that they make us lose control, particularly anger
importance of emotional regulation
    promotes mental well-being
    enhances relationships
    boosts decision-making
mindfulness techniques for emotional regulation
    observation without judgment
    RAIN technique
        recognize the emotion
        allow it to exist without trying to change it
        investigate the emotion's origin and the body's response
        non-identification, meaning you're not owning that the emotion expressed is NOT who you are
    grounding techniques - simple tasks like touching an object, focusing on your breath, and counting
    mindful responding - taking a few deep breaths before responding
    visualization - visualizing the feeling as a wave passing over you
daily practices for enhancing emotional regulation
    consistent mindfulness meditation
    journaling
    physical activity
mindfulness is connected to impulse control
    it can lead to flare-ups that create regrettable situations and strained relationships
    impulsive reactions are driven by the desire for immediate gratification, specifically in giving quick relief for uncomfortable emotions
    impulsivity thrives in the absence of reflection because it doesn't consider the consequences
mindfulness as a tool for impulse management
    consciously take a deep breath, which creates a gap between stimulus and response
    connect with the physical sensations in your body, such as the weight of your feet on the ground or a heartbeat
    ask yourself "is this reaction beneficial for me or others?"
    visualize the consequences of acting on the impulse, which should act as a deterrent
    STOP technique
        stop whatever you're doing
        take a breath
        observe the feelings and thoughts
        proceed with a more mindful response
enhancing impulse control with daily mindfulness practices
    meditative reflection - dedicate a few minutes each day to where you felt, then contemplate the triggers, your reactions, and potential alternative responses
    mindful eating - eat slowly, savoring each bite, and resist the urge to rush
    journaling - note impulsive thoughts as they arise
    limiting instant gratifications - challenge yourself occasionally
impulse control isn't about suppression, but about making an informed choice

creating a mindful lifestyle
    creates holistic well-being
    enhances self-awareness
    reduces stress levels
daily routines for mindfulness
    mindful mornings - a few minutes of focused breathing or meditation at the beginning of the day
    mindful commuting
    mindful eating
    mindful work breaks
    digital detox - certain times where you disconnect from technology
having a mindful home environment
    quiet spaces like a cozy corner or a comfortable chair
    mindful decor - soft lighting, plants, calming wall colors
    digital-free zones
    mindful activities - requires full attention such as gardening, painting or washing dishes
mindfulness in social interactions
    active listening
    non-judgmental interactions
    mindful communication - choose your words carefully

underlying causes of anger
    1. unmet needs - a threat to safety
    2. grief and loss
    3. boundaries being violated by controlling people
    4. disappointment and smashed expectations
        we must release the idea that we're in control
    5. guilt and shame based identity
        universal criticsm, abuse, and trauma smashes our sense of self
    6. unforgiveness - bitterness, resentment, and revenge
    7. vitamin deficiency (e.g., Vitamin B3, Niacin, B6, Zinc, etc.)
    8. substance abuse (alcohol and other drugs)

neuroplasticity - our brain is framed by 3 major things
    1. thoughts - changes our brain genetics (epigenetics), electromagnetic signals, and chemicals
    2. words - expressing our thoughts and reflecting our attitude, which gives life or death to our body and soul
    3. deeds (actions) - we have free will to influence all of the above, which creates a positive or negative feedback loop
how we learn
    1. repetition - builds habits
    2. focused attention - releases learning/memory neurotransmitter (acetylcholine)
    3. pleasure from learning (seeing reward and benefits) - releases a pleasure neurotransmitter (dopamine)

life all hangs on loving, meaningful relationships
    all of it is about love

Body
Soul
    Emotions
    Mind
    Free Will
    Emotions go to the mind, the mind goes to free will
Spirit

the heart has its own "little brain" of 40,000 neurons

we must listen to that small, still voice within us

psychospirituality
    being human always relates and points to something other than itself
    i.e., something or someone is always the object of a human being

stages of life:
1. infancy - complete dependence
2. toddler stage - learning basic life skills
3. adult - now officially responsible, can now move to parenthood
4. parenthood - meeting own needs and childrens'
5. elderhood - parenthood for parents

unmet needs lead to primary emotions
    Love and intimacy needs:
        Alienation
        Abandonment
        Loneliness
    Acceptance and belonging needs:
        Rejection
    Identity, Value, Meaning and Purpose:
        Worthlessness
        Hopelessness
        Powerlessness
    Safety, Security and Boundaries:
        Fear
        Frustration
        Insecurity
The primary emotions create secondary emotions
    Anger/Rage
    Anxiety
    Depression
We then create coping behaviors
    self-protective
    styles of relating (masks)
    addictive behaviors
        chemicals
        sexual
        gambling
        workaholism
        eating disorders
    Type A & B trauma
    3 D's:
        Denial
        Dissociation
        Delusion

whenwe face a crisis of meaning, we have an increased risk for antisocial aspects
    suicide and depression
    homicide and aggression
    addictions (alcohol, other drugs, gambling, etc)

we must manage the feelings that come BEFORE the secondary emotions if we're going to get anywhere

loving characteristics are the things that make us trust people
    integrity
    honesty
    loyalty
    faithfulness
    commitment
    self-control
    respect
    mercy
    grace
    compassion
    understanding
    kindness
we build a network of trust based on loving characteristics
    we open ourselves to others in relation to how much we believe we can trust them
    without those trust-based relationships, we get locked out of our relationships
    it takes time to learn who to trust, when to trust, and how much to trust
if we don't find love, we settle into addictive behaviors
when addictions don't work (and they won't) we'll do the 3 D's to step away from it
there are levels of deflecting from the real problems, and they will escalate as they're not resolved long-term
    level 1 - verbal
        passive - I'm stupid
        aggressive - You're stupid
    level 2 - physical
        passive - self-harm, self-mutilation
        aggressive - assaults, violence
    level 3 - death
        passive - suicide
        aggressive - murder

identity requires healthy role modeling and healthy mirrors
    it requires a community that loves us

meaninglessness predisposes us for
    suicide/depression
    homicide/aggression
    addictions
the existential vacuum
    there are 3 avenues that lead up to meaning and fulfillment
        1. doing a deed or creating a work
        2. experiencing something or encountering someone (i.e., love)
        3. (the most important) facing a fate we cannot change, we are called upon to make the best of it by rising above ourselves and growing beyond ourselves (i.e., changing ourselves)

if we don't experience loving relationships, we will let addictions and compulsions come in and take over
    these can become highly advanced, with pent-up pressure exploding in a terrible way

guilt is related to behavior when shame is related to identity
how to fix a broken identity
    1. understand the importance of living with a clean conscience, which builds a form of respect for yourself that draws ~90% of the people
        some people will certainly hate you, but most will fall in love with you
    2. understand you're born as a unique masterpiece (created by God)
        recognize you don't have to be like others, or that others' experiences aren't going to be yours
    3. recognize your gifts, talents, and abilities
        it gives a sense of value and identity
    4. find meaning and purpose to life
        by using gifts, talents, and abilities, you have a reason to get out of bed, and you find yourself as a necessary piece of the puzzle of society

signs you may be getting angry
- muscular tightening, especially around the jaw and arms
- sensation of building pressure in the head
- sensations of heat and flushing in the face
- elevated heart rate, breathing or sweating
all physical reactions that the body is preparing for "fight or flight"
the point is to defuse the situation BEFORE it gets out of control

The mind must be trained to listen to principles, values, and morals
    the purpose is to act, not react
    to react is to let bullies and controllers control me
    we were designed to be loving people, and reacting is working against that (even if we were trained to it)

communicating about important things in the evening is not a good idea
    people are tired, the day has been difficult
    postpone it until the next morning

lock off time to share perspective
    5 minute timer, then swap to the other
    make it clear that if you disagree, write it down and you can come back to it
    if there are interruptions, respectfully communicate that you understand they disagree, and that they'll have a chance to speak (i.e., "I respected you while you spoke, so please respect me while I'm speaking)
    let both sides give their 5 minute summary, then both of you sleep on it
        the point is to carefully work through it
        delaying is against instant gratification, but will maximize the outcome
    it takes time to work through conflicts peaceably
speak to people the way you want to be spoken to

unforgiveness can linger and make it difficult to heal
    however, we are responsible to forgive others

neuroplasticity - 3 important principles of brain learning, healing, and adaptation
    1. repetition - via [habit]
    2. focused attention - releases a learning/memory neurotransmitter (acetylcholine)
    3. pleasure from learning (seeing reward and benefits) - releases a pleasure neurotransmitter (dopamine)
    unfortunately, this works irrespective of its [moral] qualities (good or bad, encouraging or [addiction])
    we can neuroplastically retranscribe (change or rewire) toxic memories, and it can reprogram our epigenetics in the process
    when you consciously think, thoughts bcome unstable and must be altered in some direction
    even if you don't change the content of the thought, it'll rewrite with new proteins: no thought stays neutral
    we can change those pathways within 4 days, and can create new ones within 21 days
    up to 80% of our physical and mental health issues could originate from our thought life
    the entire system requires integrity: what you think on the inside is expressed by what you do on the outside
    we define our epigenetics, NOT the other way around
        for that to happen, we must take responsibility for our words, actions, and behaviors

when it comes to addiction, we naturally develop a tolerance that normalizes our phenomenon
- this is because our psychological state adapts to anything that's part of the background noise
- application: you will do better to remove bad things from your life than add new things that distract from those bad things

our dopamine system wants the next 15 seconds of pleasure
- it doesn't care about anything further than that

our addictions basically scale, then make everything else lame by comparison
- this basically "hacks" the system to override toward that addictive behavior
- the only cure is abstinence, which basically re-normalizes the body through a state of protracted sickness that brings back the nuances that come with daily living

chemicals affect visual-spatial processing
    distance, coordination, reaction, concentration

we need to make ~1500 decisions while driving
