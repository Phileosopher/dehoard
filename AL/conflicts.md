to avoid the worst of a projection while asserting a boundary
- swap the pronoun of their accusation and use a high-context response
- e.g., "you're not being very nice" 
- "I appreciate your transparency"
- advanced level: "...and it's good we're being open with our failings"
- if you do it enough, you will perplex them enough that they won't be able to attack you
