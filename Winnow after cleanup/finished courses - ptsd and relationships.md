1. look at where you are and where you want to be
    - you have to move to a higher level than you've accepted
    - you don't have to be perfect to be ready for love
    write down PRECISELY and CLEARLY what you want
        do NOT hedge the desire: you're choosing across millions of potential people
        that desire should be sensible without rationalization (e.g., marriage with kids)
            if that desire is higher, think of it as a [success] goal to improve your attractability (e.g., become physically attractive to get better prospects)

## emergency measures to re-regulate

Ten Emergency Measures to Re-Regulate
1. Notice when you are dysregulated! Are you flooding with emotion? Adrenaline? Panic?
Say to yourself “I’m having an emotional reaction.” This is a good time to slow down and
be gentle with yourself and others, so you don’t say or do something you’ll regret later.
2. Be safe. This is not a good time to drive a car. Pull over and take your time. If what
triggered you was an argument, use gentle words to stop the interaction for now, like “I
want to continue this conversation, but I need to take a breather to calm down.” Or, if you
don’t want to tell the other person that you’re triggered, tell them you need a bathroom
break, or if you’re on the phone, say you have a call on the other line. Don’t get into a big
discussion about it -- just find a way to put the conversation on pause.
3. Buy some time. Separate from the other person if you can. Go to a room by yourself,
even if it’s the bathroom. No one has to know what you’re doing. If it feels urgent, take
even longer before you try to resolve anything.
4. Stamp your feet. You’d be amazed how helpful it is to bring yourself back into present
time, in your body. As you stamp each foot, say quietly to yourself "right" "left" "right"
"left.” This helps your brain begin to re-regulate.
5. Take ten deep breaths, focusing particularly on the out breath.
6. Press your tongue to the back of your teeth. This is a strategy to get back in your body.
7. Sit down, and feel the weight of your butt in the chair. This is another strategy to get
back inside your body.
8. Eat something. When you’re stressed, you’ll probably crave carbs and sugar, but it’s
protein foods that will help you get grounded again.
9. Wash your hands, and feel the water and soap on your hands. Warm water is
particularly calming.
10. Get a good, squeezing hug. If no one is around, press your back into a corner and wrap
your arms around yourself so you can feel pressure all around your torso. We’re wired to
calm down when we’re hugged!

action, huge, unrealistic expectations and promises,
inflating the importance of relationships, events,
personal attributes, prospects. Obsession, stalking,

## attraction to unavailable or inappropriate people

Was married or in a serious
relationship with someone other than
me, while we were together?

Wanted to keep our relationship
secret

Was alcoholic or had an addiction

Was not in love with me

Was emotionally not there for me

Had serious drama that stood in the
way of our relationship (for example,
a feud with an ex)

Insisted on seeing other people, even
though that’s not what you wanted

Would not commit to you, even though
that’s what you wanted

Was not aware of your love for them
(“just friends”)

Caused you to feel ashamed that you
were with such an inappropriate
person

NOTE: when we put up with bad behavior, we're emotionally unavailable
- we don't realize it, but we're cutting ourselves off from more meaningful relationships and connections

there are many reasons why this may be the case:
    it's possible that our flawed parenting can predispose us to bad attractions
    it's also possible we're repeating our childhood experiences to see if we can "fix" it
    it may make us so disconnected that ANY connection will hijack our entire central nervous system
    we may be thinking that only unhealthy people would ever accept us for who we are
    traumatized people have an unconscious language they share with each other
        though, they'll ping-pong their trauma back-and-forth
    even when we crave unavailable people, we ourselves were unavailable, and we'll consciously say we want commitment but will unconsciously choose a partner that won't have much in the emotional connection department
    we may enjoy getting hurt ("masochism") or love risk, but it's more that we're often going into relationships completely blind
TO AL HARDSHIP
however, it doesn't matter WHY, and all that matters is that we create structures that support us toward what we want
you never really have to figure out WHY, and simply need to know WHAT, and then what to do to make it stop

## fitting ourselves to bad things

codependence - we find someone with problems, then conform ourselves to them
    they become a project for us to revolve our lives around, which is easy to do when we have no structure of our own
    this can work for a time, since that person will be fine with it, up until they find it adverse, then they'll push away
justifying - stating that if you leave, bad things will happen
    we imply that we need to do something
psychologizing - a type of justifying based on psychological diagnoses
    we're basically counting on someone who cannot commit
fantasizing - imagining things in our mind as a type of escape
    it will either attract people who are also fantasizing, or people whose prefer that someone's soul is not really there
mysticizing - making a religious basis to justify bad behavior
    past lives, astrology, soul mates, etc
    since relationships are very much a day-to-day experience, they must exist in a day-to-day way
    "I'm experiencing things I'm meant to learn"
    "I cheated on them in a past life, so I'm now experiencing what they experienced"
    if they're a soul mate, they're a mate to every part of you

## intimacy triggers

Getting attention

Being ignored

Being loved

Not being loved

Being IN love

Being reminded of past relationships
or hurts

Being reminded of past abuse

Fear of abandonment

Sharing money, friends,
responsibilities, space

Partner’s anger

Feeling embarrassed by partner

Fighting with partner

Feeling not good enough for partner

We have to be our authentic selves
- it's not uncommon for us to have past trauma that forces us to place a false persona outwardly to others

## unacceptable people and situations

Did I try to “help” someone who was
capable of helping themselves?

Did I financially support someone
where this was not deserved or
appropriate?

Did I tolerate addiction/alcoholism in
my partner, to a degree that
damaged my own life?

Did I tolerate emotional abuse
(threats, name-calling, making a scene
in public)

Did I allow myself to be controlled?

Did I tolerate disrespectful behavior
like cheating, public intoxication,
verbal abuse?

Did I tolerate physical abuse?

Did I allow my partner to keep me
apart from friends and family, or
disrupt my career?

Did I spiritualize or mysticise or use
magical thinking to convince myself

our relationship was more real than it
was?

Did I fantasize about someone
unavailable to me, to the point it
interfered with relationships, or other
parts of my life?

## your role in problems

Blame my parents for problems that were at
least partly caused by me?

Blame a partner for problems where, when
I’m honest, I shared responsibility?

Verbally or emotionally abuse a partner
(for example, name calling, making threats,
making a scene in public)

Physically hurt a partner?

Hide my role in creating problems, in order
to make a partner feel guilty, or to prove a
point?

Neglect my physical health (avoiding
healthcare, dental care, using drugs/alcohol
to a harmful degree, let myself go in terms
of hygiene)

Fall into black and white thinking, judging
people as all good or all bad
Lie to partners, friends, employers, the
government, etc.,

Gravitate toward unfulfilling or poorly paid
jobs, believing somehow others would solve
this problem for me?

Use lawsuits or restraining orders frivolously,
in order to retaliate against perceived
hurts?

Falsely accuse someone (even a public
figure) of a crime, or gossiped about them,
that hurt their reputation?

Fail to stand up for myself at critical
moments?

Lose my temper in a way that later made
me feel ashamed?

Avoid people and normal levels of
participation in groups or community?

Use sex or aggression or provocative
behavior to manipulate anyone or push them
to do things they didn’t want to do?

Allow myself to fall into debt, when it could
have been avoided, or when common sense
actions could get me out?

Repeat the same mistakes without
knowing why?

Assume responsibility for things that are
NOT my fault, just to feel some control
over those problems?

Hear from people close to me that they
feel I take advantage of them?

Expect too much of myself to a point
that I never knew what is my fault and
what is not?

Fear what I’d have to face, and what I’d
have to do, if I took responsibility for my
mistakes?

We can have trouble with relationships from several angles
    Hiding - pulling away from everything
    Escaping - can be ANY [substance], really
    Clinging - overly enmeshed with someone
    Controlling - trying to make someone do something
        can also be subtle, such as yelling at people or calculating

## fear of being alone

Hooked up with, lived with or married
someone I didn’t really want to be with,
just to avoid being alone?

Stayed in relationships where I wasn’t
loved or respected, just to avoid being
alone?

Suffered from fear of abandonment to
an unhealthy degree?

Fell into an “abandonment depression,”
where being left caused a negative
mental state way out of proportion to
the situation, or to what other people
seem to experience?

Have never lived alone?

Fill my time with “busy-ness”, or activities
I don’t actually enjoy, just to avoid being
alone?

what to do if this fear exists:
1. work on re-regulation muscles
2. seriously build connections with people EVERYWHERE
    - we're part of a web of people, and are very social
    - the partner should never be the end-all and be-all of our lives
3. make a list of 25 things you can do alone

## steps to take

we must take our own responsibility for our problems
- many of our problems are NOT self-created, but we've inherited it
- it's a "debt" we are responsible to pay off, and will live with that debt's consequences until we pay it off

addictions have a tendency to "stick" with others
- there are MANY resources for most [addictions]

it's not uncommon to have hate
- hate comes from generalized statements that arise in the presence of other issues

we must get our act together to clear the decks
- this must come from a sincere approach to find closure together

## how to break up

some people get into lopsided relationships where one person doesn't like the other
- the one who has feelings get an object of their affections
- the one without feelings gets adoring, caring attention
you're trading the benefits of availability for the short-term emotional attachment that goes nowhere

“I wanted to talk to you about our friendship. I have the sense that there’s some attraction on your
part, and though I really like you and value your friendship, I don’t have those kinds of feelings for
you. It’s not your fault. You’ve done nothing wrong. I’m working on cleaning up my life and my
relationships, because I want to one day be in a healthy relationship, and it’s made me realize I need
to end our friendship. I’m sorry.”

also be honest about your feelings with them:
“I want to talk about our friendship. When I’m honest with myself, I notice that I’ve always had an
attraction to you, but I know that’s not the way you feel about it. And that’s fine. I’ve been working on
my capacity to have better relationships and I’ve realized that as much as I love having you as a
friend, it’s kind of “using up” the part of me that needs to be emotionally available. It’s not your fault!
You’ve done nothing wrong. But I’ve come to the realization that I need to end our friendship so I can
move on.”

avoid criticizing, blaming, or shaming them whatsoever

For partners who have treated you well, but it’s just not a match:
● Remember that they deserve communication and honesty, even if it is gentle.
● Take into consideration how long you’ve been dating, and how close the relationship is.
● If you’ve been dating less than about six months, this need only be a single conversation.
● I recommend breaking up in person, unless you’ve only been dating a very short time.
● The best place to meet is in a public place where no one can make a scene, but not so
public that there’s no privacy.
● Let the person know that you are breaking up with them first thing in the conversation. You
do need to give them a reason, but give the minimal amount of information so that they
can understand why.
● Be kind but be clear. Avoid criticizing, blaming or shaming the other person.
● Don’t leave it open-ended, even if it seems like this will make it easier.
● If they are upset, it’s OK to hug them, but make it quick and “cool.” Don’t send mixed
signals.
● Limit the conversation to 20 or 30 minutes.
● If it’s a relationship that’s gone on longer 3-6 months, you might follow the initial
conversation with a phone planned phone call a few days later, once they’ve had a
chance to process what’s happened.
● Don’t agree to get together in person unless it’s necessary to exchange belongings (if you
must do that, consider bringing a friend along with you).
● Don’t get sucked into taking care of them. Don’t suggest you will stay friends, or give them
hope.
● When it’s done, don’t call or text them, and don’t invite them to gatherings, or go where
you will see them (not initially, anyway).
● If you’ve been living with the person, you can adapt the rules as best you can. Set up your
next living situation in advance, so that you can make your exit as soon as possible after
you’ve informed them that you’re breaking up. Let them know of your decision, and go
stay somewhere else until the day when you can remove your things. Don’t stick around
living together until the month is up and your new place is ready.
● Pay your share of the rent for at least a month or two, and then get assistance removing
your things; don’t do it by yourself. If you can arrange openly to do this while your ex is
out of the house, that is a lot easier on them. Be fair and generous in terms of what you
leave behind.

If you are leaving someone who has behaved hurtfully toward you (e.g. cheating,
addiction):
● Limit communication, but don’t ghost them. Likewise, don’t unload on them or berate them.
● Get help to remove your things, pay rent for one month if you choose to, and then don’t
look back.
