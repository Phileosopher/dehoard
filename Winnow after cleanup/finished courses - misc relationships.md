every person in a relationship will eventually find MANY irritating little things about their partner

we are taught the wrong thing: that love is meant to be the perfect merger of two lives
- live in the same house
- eat the same meals together
- go to bed and get up at the same time
- only have sex with (or even sexual thoughts) about each other
- frequently see each other's families
- have all their friends in common
- think the same thoughts on every topic at every moment

it's an impossibly punitive burden of expectation on another person

another perspective: relationships are fulfilling for 3 different reasons:
1. kindness - gentle with our imperfections and can tolerate us as we are
2. shared vulnerability - open about anxieties, worries, and problems that throw us off, that we can share in weakness
3. understanding - can make sense of our own mind, and who we can understand in turn
we end up feeling loved or satisfied in any other areas if those are in place
we'd still likely feel lonely and short on relations even if we knew all the same information together

Non-negotiables
1. Will we stay married?
2. We must stop labeling each other
  You are..., you do..., because of...
3. We need couples therapy
  We will need intervention if this can go anywhere
