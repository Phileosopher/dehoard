social and emotional learning (SEL) is how people come to feelings, and how they respond to them
- high-skill SEL means people can often gain support from others, amplify others' positive feelings, and express gratitude

5 reasons emotions matter:
1. attention, memory, and learning - helps us to focus
2. decision-making - determines how well we make good decisions
3. relationships - they affect how we get along with others
4. physical and mental health - they determine how well we keep the little [habits] that keep us well, as well as our state of mental wellness
5. creativity - our feelings reflect in what we create

GIS FEELINGS: we can measure emotions on 2 spectra:
1. pleasantness
2. energy/intensity
    - this is directly correspondent to the amount of [certainty] a person possesses
this creates 4 quadrants:
- high-energy, pleasant ("yellow")
    - people tend to think [creatively] and generate new ideas
    - they're also inclined toward group activities
- low-energy, pleasant ("green")
    - promotes self-reflection and consensus-building
    - the best time for collaboration
- high-energy, unpleasant ("red")
    - heightened awareness that keeps people alert
    - good for competitive activities or passionate expression
- low-energy, unpleasant ("blue")
    - helps for deductive reasoning and critical thinking
    - primes for relating to others' misfortune, which builds empathy
these wobble around on the graph proportionally to how fast we have a thought
- it means that beyond a certain level of intelligence or [creativity], the emotions are impossible to precisely track

it helps a LOT to get specific words for various feelings
- look for when there are modifiers (e.g., "really", so", "very", such as "very happy")
- avoid the words "fine", "okay", "good" when someone asks how you're doing
- learn a new emotion word every day

Managing our emotions is not about suppressing them, controlling them, or conforming to someone else’s idea about what we should do or feel. It’s not just about calming down. We manage emotions so that we can think clearly, make the best decisions, form and maintain healthy relationships, and experience well-being.

everyone's situation for managing feelings is different, as well as their cultural background

we have to ask about whether a feeling will be helping us or not
unhelpful action strategies:
- negative self-talk
    - instead, use positive self-talk
- blaming oneself or others
    - instead, use humor
- complaining
    - instead, use positive reappraisal
- procrastination
    - instead, use social support
- avoidance
    - instead, use acceptance
- psychological manipulation
    - instead, avoid or modify the situation
- denial
    - instead, seek professional help
- yelling or screaming
- suppression
- physical aggression
    - instead, do a constructive activity
- ignoring the emotion
- poor habits (eating, sleep, exercise)
    - instead, try healthy habits
- ignoring the problem
    - instead, try problem solving
- abusing substances
    - instead, try a short-term distraction
- rumination or worry
- wishful thinking
    - instead, use visualization

there are many healthy contributors that lead to a better emotional state:
- eating healthy
- physical activity
- getting enough sleep
- physical touch
- emotionally connecting with others
- doing what you prefer

We can also mentally reframe the situation
- positive self-talk that offsets the negative dialogue in our minds
- positive reframing - look at things in the best possible light
- compartmentalizing - intentionally working through feelings at a later, more opportune time
- focus on gratitude - look at what you have instead of what you don't have
- find meaning - seeing how your role fits into the bigger picture
- savor good things - dwell on positive experiences and focus on how those good things feel
- mindfulness - find inner calm

we have to shift our strategies for how we look at emotions
- enhance self-awareness and education on the matter
- have conversations across differences with others
- stay present and use active listening
- stay receptive, and avoid defensiveness
- consider the difference between intent and impact
    - if the impact was bad, the intent doesn't matter regarding whether that thing should be changed
we must constantly acknowledge our biases
- learn others' stories
- focus less on empathy (which requires legitimate experience) and more on understanding their feelings and why those feelings exist
- use our feelings to provoke us to change

meaningful work is done when feelings are directly addressed
- we have a need to be seen, heard, and understood

reading others' feelings can be challenging due to several barriers
- we sometimes fail to notice or pay attention to someone else
- we might want to control others' emotions
- our thoughts revert to how we felt in a similar situation, and NOT how the other person feels

we tend to be better at reading the emotions of people when we have spent more time around them
- when people are less familiar, our minds revert to a threat-detection system that asks whether we should approach or avoid them
- feelings run faster than thoughts, so the more that people are different from us, the more we must exert the mental effort to pause
    - we need to stop the emotional reaction to engage the prefrontal cortex

PARENTING: feelings express differently for different ages
- young children often regress when afraid over time
- elementary school children may express bodily complaints, act out, express learning problems, talk excessively, or other actions
- middle and high school students may engage in reckless or destructive behavior

tricks to read feelings
    use the pleasantness/intensity mood meeter to gauge feelings
    watch for repeated patterns and themes
    learn their stories to understand them better
how to ask about feelings
    find the right time and place to discuss the matter
    go in with an inviting attitude
        check in with your own feelings to see if you're in a helpful place, then examine how long you'll stay that way and how you'd shift
        elicit their thoughts and let them lead the conversation
        listen without judgment for the purpose of understanding
        convey they're not a burden and that you want to hear what they have to say
        be patient and wait for them to speak
        stay in your lane: this is about them, not you
        if you become activated, be curious about your activation and take responsibility for it
    try phrases like:
        I noticed...
        tell me what happened
        I'm listening...
        I'm wondering...
        What do you see there?
        What's interesting to you?
        I'd like to know...
        It sounds like you're saying...(paraphrase)...is that correct?
        How did you feel about that?
    When they're struggling, say:
        I noticed...
        You don't seem like yourself
        This must be difficult for you
        I know this is hard
        This sounds like a lot
        I'm sorry this happened
        I'm here for you
        You're safe here
        What do you think you can do?
        How can I help?
        We will figure this out together
        Feelings are normal, they are signals
    Be sure to avoid:
        Telling them how they should feel
        belittling them
        interrupting them
        telling them how you felt (unless it's brief and sympathizes)
        Elevating their feelings without guiding them to safety or validation
        Dismissing their ideas or feelings
        Pressuring them in any way
        Blaming them for any circumstances
        Diagnosing

Someone's behavior doesn't indicate their feelings
- it's simply a signal to pause and closely consider the issues at hand

We can normalize behaviors that promote awareness of feelings
    Ask people to share with each other
    Incorporate emotion language throughout the day
    Give a more specific answer when asked how you're doing
    Add emotionally supportive routines to the day
    Consider a reflection support group
    Notice other people and what they're doing
    Practice active listening with a partner

we must learn how we're influencing others' feelings
- we have an influence on how people feel, whether we know it or not
- controlling how we influence others is a tremendous power
- we're responsible to help others to the degree we have that power, especially those we love and care for

We can make space for our authentic selves while also giving them room to heal
- emotional co-regulation is the ongoing process where one person's emotions are influenced by the actions and emotional reactions of the other
- commands are NOT co-regulation
- co-regulation involves a few steps:
    1. acknowledge their feelings and the energy associated with it
    2. use a brief mindfulness exercise or ask how they feel about it

MGMT: when someone activates, we only have SOME control over the situation
- we can't control many factors
ask a few questions about the matter:
- when can I physically have a necessary conversation? in another room?
- how will other people be affected while I take this matter privately

5 steps to managing a stressful moment:
1. manage your own feelings
    - you can't help anyone else if you're dysregulated
2. help them with their feelings
    - first, help them settle their physical activation, which may come in several approaches
        - be present and wait quietly
        - be patient
        - offer the chance for a walk, a glass of water, or a reminder to breathe
        - make an affirming response that shows you're present or that they're okay
    - then, help them explore their feelings
        - start with reviewing the story of what happened in their own words
        - listen and reflect without judging, with the goal being to understand their perspective and put their feelings into words
        - after that, shift the focus to helping them name their feelings, though that may vacillate back-and-forth with the story depending on the person
3. brainstorm and make plans
    - look at the problems that need to be solved, and the next steps that may be helpful
    - your job is NOT to provide an answer, but instead to be a coach
    - the next steps might be small (like considering a different perspective) or large (like having a difficult conversation)
    - if someone is grieving, they simply may need someone present in silence to give them permission to grieve
    - some examples:
        - what are some ideas you have about how you could deal with this?
        - what do you think you could do next?
        - I know how thoughtful and creative you are, and I wonder what you think is best.
        - what would you advise your best friend to do in this situation if they were feeling how you feel?
    - you can also make your suggestion, but make sure to ask to be sure they know you trust their judgment:
        - Can I help you think about what your next step might be?
        - I like all of your ideas. Would you like to brainstorm more some together before you choose?
        - Is there anything I can do?
        - Would you like me to offer some ideas?
    - many times they simply want to be heard and seen, and don't really care about next steps at the time
    - sometimes it'll vacillate between self-regulation, naming feelings, and next steps until they land on a decision that seems right
4. close the conversation
    - try to end with a positive or constructive note
    - identify what can be revisited later
    - remind them how no feelings are ever final or forever
    - reiterate the next step and that you'll follow up with them later
    - some examples:
        - thanks for sharing your story and allowing me to help you strategize, I am glad we had time together
        - trust your judgment about this, you made a clear decision
        - it's okay if your next step isn't perfect, you can learn from that too
        - I'll be there for you, just let me know when you want to talk again 
5. follow up later
    - most important issues aren't "solved" on the first try, so check back later to offer more support
    - discretely ask them later (e.g., "how'd it go?", "how did that thing work out for you?")
    - reinforce their strengths and growth mindset
    - let them know that their strategies will sometimes not work
    - offer your continued availability to support them
    - you may have to go back and forth between managing your own feelings and helping them become more skilled at managing THEIR feelings
    - some feelings are resolved quickly, while others must be endured and put into perspective
    - your compassionate support will go a long way toward helping people

SEL's major skillset comes from RULER
1. Recognizing emotions in oneself and others
2. Understanding the causes and consequences of emotions
3. Labeling emotions with a nuanced vocabulary
4. Expressing emotions aligned with cultural norms and social context
5. Regulating emotions with helpful strategies
