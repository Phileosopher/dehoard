CBT works on a triangle of:
    - Thoughts
    - Emotions
    - Behaviors

Catch it
Check it
Change it

1. Charge Up (aka behavior activation)
    - it's our natural impulse to drop things and hide
    - however, we need to get going to recharge our emotional state
    - at the same time, we can easily burn out if we just push ourselves into something
    - there are 3 key steps to consider:
        A. what to do
            - choose something you intend to do that recharges you
            - Any activity that you have time and space for are good choices, especially any activity that involves movement
            - it must be doable, measurable, and repeatable
                * Doable - you can start and finish the activity without using all your remaining energy
                * Measurable - quantifiable, specifically that you know when it starts and when it ends (i.e., [certainty])
                * Repeatable - you can do it over and over without using all your remaining energy
                PERSONAL NOTE: it must be a rhythmic, atomic, distinct task
                THEY FAILED TO NOTE THAT IT MUST ALSO BE PRODUCTIVELY HEALTHY (e.g., gym or a ritual)
            Necessary groupings:
                Myself
                My relationships
                My education
                My profession
                My health
            we tend to let other things get in the way
                - PERSONAL NOTE: we do it because our souls stop tending to itself to concern itself with the body and others
                - the trick is to merge it into an already-existing routine
        B. how to do it
            the failure often comes from the domain of trying to do too much at once
            we frequently need to PLAN AHEAD for the recharge sessions
            therefore, scheduling a planned emotional recharge session is important
            do NOT leave it to chance, since it will likely get overtaken by everything else
        C. why to do it
            we tend to have obstructive thoughts and feelings that prevent us from adequate self-care
            to avoid this, we need to know EXACTLY why it matters
            write down a goal, then indicate an activity that advances a goal in that domain
        NOTE: it's also VERY helpful to get someone else who can support you and keep you accountable
2. Face Fears (aka exposure therapy)
    - the idea is simple: systematically expose yourself to the things that you're afraid of, which builds tolerance for those things
    we tend to respond to fear with 3 avenues:
        1. fight - reactive or aggressive steps
        2. flight - remove oneself from the situation as fast as possible
        3. freeze - ignore or or avoid a threat
    fear is responding to a legitimate threat, but anxiety is anticipatory
    it's not uncommon to exercise avoidance when we're exposed to fears
    - avoidance allows us to quickly relieve discomfort, but it holds us back long-term
    Subjective Units of Distress (SUDs) gives a means of tracking distress, from 0 to 100
    - the higher the number, the more likely someone will avoid a discomforting thing
    - at 100, we have a "limbic hijack", where our emotional brain (amygdala) takes over our thinking brain (prefrontal cortex)
    to face our fears, we must do "looping" by revisiting the same fears over and over again
    - the trick is to find [creative] ways to revisit the same thing regularly and intensify it each time
    it's not uncommon for something that may have a rating (e.g., 20 for going out in public) to ratchet up to a much higher rating because of another condition (e.g., 50 for going out in public with sandals)
    - build an "approach ladder" by making a list of approaches with a SUD on each, then ordering from lowest to highest
    you can also Charge Up by taking doable, measurable, repeatable actions
    take your time: too much exposure and you'll overload and have a limbic hijack
3. Observe the TEB Cycle (Thoughts, Emotions, and Behaviors)
    when the limbic system triggers, our mind goes racing to fix things
    - the TEB cycle allows us to slow down that thinking
    First, pick a thought (anchoring)
    Then, indicate all the emotions about that thought
    - there may be many
    Finally, indicate the behaviors that are happening
    It's not uncommon for behaviors to create MORE thoughts, emotions, and behaviors
    Pausing to consider TEB is a learned skill, and can even apply to severe situations once honed
    often, proportionally to someone's intelligence or [creativity], their emotions may lead instead to more thoughts, which can create a loop:
        A. Thought that judges what someone says
        B. Emotions, often severe
        C. Thought from what imagining a behavior from that emotion
        D. More emotions
        E. eventually, making a statement that doesn't always make sense
        Often, entire belief systems can be assembled this way 
4. Solve Problems
    Solving problems can have emotional impact, so there's a procedure to get it solved:
    1. identify the problem by clearing pinpointing the differences between your current situation and desired outcome
    2. state the problem with facts, not emotions, and stick to one problem at a time
        - if it seems challenging, you have a sticky problem, and you'll need to divide it into smaller problems that combine together
    3. state the goal, or desired outcome, being specific and realistic
    Once you know what to do, make an action plan by specifying each small step you have to take
    after some time, consider if you've succeeded, then change plans as needed
5. Explore Thoughts
    we have many thoughts, and often think they're factual
    - however, thoughts are not facts
    we face many cognitive distortions that skew the truth:
        mind-reading - assuming we know what others are thinking
        catastrophizing - hyperfocus on the worst-case scenario
        emotional reasoning - building reasoning about the world off of how we feel
        personalization - persoanlly connecting something that isn't about you
        should - assertions of what you imagine ought to have happened
        black and white thinking - binary either/or statements
    evaluate all the thoughts with analysis:
        What is the evidence for this thought?
        What is the evidence against this thought?
        Are you expecting the worst? Write down one other way the situation could turn out that is different from this prediction.
        Does your thought contain extreme language - for example, the words "always," "forever," "never," "must," or "should"? If so, rephrase the thought using more balanced language.
        Is the thought helpful?
    the results will mean generating alternative thoughts
        this does NOT mean pushing away the old thoughts ("thought suppression")
        what it means is that we reassemble new thoughts into our mind ("cognitive restructuring")
        it's essentially a dialectic that reframes the original thought with more information

## Thinking Routines

I Notice, I Wonder
Use the sentence frames “I Notice” and “I Wonder” as starting points to record observations and questions on the media, text, or object you are looking at. When making observations, stick to what is provably present - not inferences or connections. Then consider what you still do not understand and want to know to develop questions.
Purpose:
This thinking routine is a protocol to support you in brainstorming initial notes from which you can begin to draw connections and concusions. It helps you to focus on what is and what is not present in what is in front of you, so that you can then use these questions and observations as a springboard for analysis and reflection.

Connect, Extend, Challenge
Consider what you have read, seen, or heard in the learning experiences. Ask yourself how it connects to, extends, or challenges your previous knowledge or assumptions:
            How are the ideas and information connected to what you already knew (e.g. adds further evidence)?
            What new ideas did you get that broadened your thinking or extended it in different directions (e.g. helps you take an additional step in logic or see a connection to another topic)?
            What challenges or puzzles emerge for you (e.g. raises questions, offers an alternative perspective or counterargument)?
Purpose:
This routine helps you to reflect on your learning and see how you have grown and extended your thinking as a result of it. It also provides a framework to help you respond respectively and productively to the ideas of others in discussions.

Observations-Inferences-Questions
When looking at an object, a text, or media, ask yourself:
                What do you notice? Record concrete observations
                What do you think? Record inferences and interpretations based on your observations.
                What do you wonder? Record questions and areas to clarify.
Purpose:
This routine supports your initial engagement with a topic. It sparks curiosity and supports you in building on concrete observations to draw thoughtful inferences and ask thoughtful questions.

Step Inside
Based on the evidence you have, consider the following prompts about a person and their situation:
            What can the person perceive?
            What might the person know or believe about the situation?
            What might the person care about?
Purpose:
This routine helps you to build empathy and explore different perspectives and viewpoints on situations to which the skills of the course might be applied.

3-2-1 Bridge
Before starting a topic, write down 3 words/ideas you associate with it, 2 questions you have, and 1 metaphor or simile that comes to mind. Do the same after you have completed the learning activities and consider how similar or different your responses are.
Purpose:
This routine helps you understand your learning process by providing a framework to create snapshots of your understanding at different points in time. By comparing these snapshots, you can gain insights into how your thinking has developed as a result of the learning experiences.
