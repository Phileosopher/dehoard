In some ways, I have a sideways view that probably confirms other Christians':
1. The Bible is clear on homosexuality
2. The Bible is also clear that we should be respectful of our leadership
3. In pockets of the West, the leadership is highly homosexually sympathizing
4. In light of that, we have a responsibility to speak out against something that is against the government, meaning we must be very careful.
