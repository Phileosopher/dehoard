if you're called a racist or bigot or some other slur:
- do NOT try to reason with them, since that legitimizes their claim as being reasonably established and worth discussing
- it's not a debate or formal argument: they have resorted to childlike tactics
instead, respond with something gracious but provocational back:
  - "you're a bully"
  - "that's God's judgment"
  - "what did I do to make you say that?"
  - "you're close-minded"
