
We all fail, and that's literally the way God designed it (i.e., Romans 11:32)

The key to the [good life] is fundamentally to be humble about what you don't know.

Everything in Christianity is tied to that:
A. we admit we are:
- weak
- insufficient
- sinning against others (either by commission or omission)
- volatile/inconsistent
B. accept, in that basis, that God is:
- strong
- capable
- righteous
- reliable/consistent/trustworthy
C. make actions in light of that acceptance
- [meditate] and [pray] when we feel incapable
- [release](al_happiness_2) what we can't control
- [practice spiritual disciplines] to strengthen our moral state
- learn [discipline](al_productivity_4) to become better
