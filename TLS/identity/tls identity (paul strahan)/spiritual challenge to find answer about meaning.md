Axiom: There is absolutely zero meaning in our salvation, since Christ did it all.
Q: is there meaning in gratitude?
Q: is meaning ONLY in responsibility?


Axiom: We gain life, and that abundantly, by living in righteousness.
Conclusion: meaning is derived in Christ

Paradox:
    A - there is apparently no responsibility for us in what Jesus did, beyond a simple choice of release
    B - there is apparently responsibility for us in what we are to do in RESPONSE to Jesus' actions
    C - however, we can't add to our salvation or faith, only God gives the increase
So, where is the self-determination? Where is the free will that creates a sense of meaning in Christ?

Clarification: meaning in Christ is separate from joy: many believers can have zero meaning but also have joy

Maybe meaning doesn't matter
  At least, maybe we must sacrifice that meaning to God

Radical self acceptance or radical ownership directly magnifies meaning
- but, we can over-claim responsibility

Meaning stops when we can do nothing else

Living a life filled with meaning is a life filled with choices
- it's endless personal responsibility, for everything
- it may also be unhealthy

Meaning can be idolized
- it comes through a person's desire to control what they shouldn't

to live in Christ is to have no meaning in daily matters
- food, paying bills, etc
- those all require trust

but, to live in Christ is to therefore have SEVERE meaning in MORAL matters
- loving others, dominantly
- abiding by God's desires (i.e., ten commandments)
- trusting in the Holy Spirit (which will reflect virtuously living in Christ)

oddly, this means Christians will find no meaning in consequences
- only the heart, at least to the degree that it's knowable

CONCLUSION: I HAVE OVERRATED MEANING, AND TO LIVE IN CHRIST IS TO ONLY FIND MEANING IN THE ACTIONS WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE

Next issue: why do I feel utter emptiness without meaning? if meaning disappears, there is no joy, no peace beyond forced calmness, no satisfaction
why it's an issue: many people find themselves happy enough in a low-meaning existence, so I am missing something
