## there is no meaning for us in salvation

Maybe meaning doesn't matter
  At least, maybe we must sacrifice that meaning to God

Radical self acceptance or radical ownership directly magnifies meaning
- but, we can over-claim responsibility

Meaning stops when we can do nothing else

## there is meaning in what we are to do

this "to do" is fundamentally uninteresting:
    wake up on time
    clean your room
    be less harsh to someone
    etc.

however, it's the basis for what God wants us to do long-term
