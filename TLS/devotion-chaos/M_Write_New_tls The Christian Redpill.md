We must live for eternity

Christian culture generally doesn't concern itself with legitimate spiritual gain  
They say 'lets get real' and 'lets devote ourselves more' and 'practical steps', but it's all useless jargon

Side thought: spiritual abuse can never separate God's predestined child  
Parable of lost sheep and prodigal son together

Why do Christian culture calls to action sound like catchphrases?

Christians must come to understand that there are MANY cultural values, and that each individual Christian will only have some connection with some of them, and WILL find offense with others.

- it's awareness of the need for open-mindedness about some things (bible verse about condemning a slave of a different master in Romans 14)
- it also means we all go back to a higher authority, but they ALL are God.
