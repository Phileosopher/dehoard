if we see the hardship of Christians without the long-term glory awaiting them, God is basically providing a spiritual Stockholm Syndrome to believers
- at the same time, if that glory is true, then Christians who suffer much have a tremendous blessing waiting for them
- in short, a Christian is essentially an utterly cursed indivdual, or an utterly blessed one, but never something halfway in between
