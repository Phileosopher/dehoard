this is the complexities that arise through the truths that God shows in Christ
- slug might be /gospel-2/

we now have immeasurable value in what we ARE, so anything we DO utterly pales in comparison
- further, it won't gain God's love more, only His approval
  - and even then, our most righteous works are like used tampons to Him ("filthy rags" verse)
- it also means that our most mortal enemies are still loved by God, and therefore worthy of our grace
