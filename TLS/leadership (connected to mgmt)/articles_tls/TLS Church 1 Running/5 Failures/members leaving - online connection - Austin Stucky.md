AUSTIN STUCKY STATEMENT

Hey everyone, and Happy Father's Day to all the dads out there.

I don't know if the timing of this post is right, but the fullness of what I've been meaning to share came to me this morning. My hope is that you are taking full advantage of the opportunity to be off of social media, to celebrate and honor Fatherhood to the extent that your are capable.

You see, God made us for human community and connection, and I've always felt that social media is a cheap substitute for community. Just as p*rn is a cheap substitute for intimacy, processed foods are a cheap substitute for food, and entertainment is a cheap substitute for joy and purpose.

The purpose of THIS page was originally designed as an extension of my now defunct ministry platform on Instagram, which it has now outgrown. The idea was to use this platform to share highlights of my personal life, but I don't know how much of it I care to share. It, like my personal Instagram, quickly turned into a Christian Truther & Ministry page.

I feel that both pages are now oversaturated with content, and I've grown tired of chain posting here. I also suspect that my motivations for staying active on either platform have been less than genuine. Either to receive words of validation from others, or to connect with a potential spouse.

To the extent that my connections online have failed to lead to face to face encounters towards the formation of authentic Christian community, this platform has failed it's intended purpose. To the extent that it has helped facilitate real life encounters and human connection towards that end, it has been successful. I hope that it will continue to do so.

My intention is for the views on this page to be life altering, and spiritually transforming, to such an extent that like minded individuals would be compelled to radically change the way that they look at church, and begin to partner with the work of God to restore the fullness of an authentic Christian community and worldview.

That is still my intention, and I feel that I am the closest to that that I have ever been. And yet, I've also grown weary of retreating to the virtual false realities portrayed on these platforms, in hopes that they will give me a feeling of comfort while I wait for said community to fully manifest.

I fundamentally object to the notion of false realities, virtual worlds, and artificial intelligence. My heart is for authentic, lived experience connected to people that I love that are right in front of me.

Because of the severe fragmentation and ultimate failure of Western Churchianity to preserve and pass down community in the way that it was experienced in the Ancient Church, paired with my own internal struggles with the ability to form deep human connections due to indulgence in false forms of intimacy and deep trauma,

I continually find myself an unfulfilled scroller on Facebook, either discouraged by the state of the country, burdened by the prevalence of false teaching, frustrated by the dating pool, and otherwise continually shocked by the human condition.

There was a time for me when exposure to Christian truth was novel, but now much of my feed is saturated with advertisements and Christian clich√©s that lack substance. Although I often agree, I find it hard to connect with the Christian truths that I have heard so often repeated without any real depth, substance, or commitment to change. This has contributed to feelings of cynicism in recent years, but it says nothing of those same people that God has called me to love and encourage.

Without a vision the people perish, and the Christian community on here is largely a people with no vision. Others are working with an incomplete vision, while most are content to remain aloof to those with true vision, instead being content to follow after Christian leaders who emphasize signs and wonders, and recite Christian cliches, while otherwise failing to establish lasting fellowships centered on Apostolic Teaching complete with the necessary communal safeguards needed to protect the flock.

I believe that the solution exists by putting into practice the specific tenants and principles that I and others have discovered through our years of studying early Christianity. But it takes a community of believers motivated by that common vision in order to provide real solutions, not just one or two men. Yet, I am a man with very limited resources, which I've discovered disqualifies you in many areas of life.

Being a fan of my work is one thing, but fundamentally altering your life and routine in order to come into agreement with the solution is quite another entirely, and it's those kind of people that I need to surround myself with in order for this to become something more than words on a screen.

At the same time, I refuse to force doors open that are not open for me. It is the Spirit of God that will ultimately have to breathe life into this vision for it to come to pass. It is the Spirit of God that will put His people into motion, not my own efforts. His burden is light, and His yoke easy.

Regardless, the blueprint is here for those who care to see it. I've shared what I've cared to share, and I will continue to be available on messenger.

I would rather endure the discomfort of facing my own personal demons in isolation, and periodically alongside the people that God has placed in my life, then to continue to retreat into artificial forms of community and pleasure.

"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."
1 Corinthians 13:12

MY MESSAGE RESPONSE

So I wanted to share something, but not sure if it's worth the public attention, regarding your long post 2 days ago.

I share the sentiment entirely. Around 2014, I had a far less adjusted view of life, was working in organic farming trying to find my way, and not much going on along the lines of a mate or potential social prospects.

You're absolutely right: social media is a cheap knockoff, like hot dogs compared to steak or a crayon drawing compared to fine art.

Social media's interests are for their own, so they have no reason to NOT use dark patterns to keep people addicted (my deeper essays on dark patterns at [NAG DESIGN](https://notageni.us/design) and [TS UX/UI](https://techsplained.xyz/ux-ui)).

We're in a sea of people, but utterly alone. The solution is to break out of the mold. I wrote some ideas near the back end of [AL PEOPLE 4](https://adequate.life/people-4).

Most adults have the problem of not having friends. Our culture doesn't maintain in adulthood the demographic variety that happens when a kid is simply playing or with other schoolchildren.

Most of our adult encounters are in the workplace, which can sometimes be VERY non-social (e.g., truck drivers, factory workers).

I'm not saying I have it figured out: I'm struggling with that "community" thing myself, but I believe it has a lot to do with our over-emphasis on ordered systems in this country.

I work in insurance all day. Irrespective of who a person appears to be or is, their legal fiction tells a different story (that AUSTIN STUCKY parallel legal entity the SS administration gave you)

To this world, we are database entries, and that's it. A product to be harvested in happiness through consumerism, in grief through medication and therapy, and the worse we get the more they can profit (e.g., being trans).

The Christian world is weak because they trust this legal fiction. That's most of my rant there.

The legal fiction creates an oversimplified story of what we DID, but never what we WILL DO or ARE, but love is the domain of ARE and hope/faith are the domain of WILL DO

Sorry if I'm not speaking in a straight line, the tinfoil hat is shorting out my brain these days.

Your feelings of solitude and isolation are American-standard living: it's a product of the mass-scale individualism we're all raised in.

Being a Christian is conformity to a philosophical value system that directly defies American individualism, and the rebellion shows itself most prevalently in 4th Wave Evangelicalism (e.g., vote Republican because it's God's will).

In short, your assertion that you're waiting for things to change is a correct observation (things haven't changed) but I believe it's a wrong action item (wait for it to change).

There's waiting like Moses (doing basically nothing) and waiting like Nehemiah (researching and yak shaving the crap out of what you want to create).

My own endeavors are ALL obsessive building for the future I want to see. Every time I get discouraged, I have converted it into anger that propels me forward.

I'm now a convicted felon because I didn't observe the time and place for NOT doing that, but it really does create the results you need and helps you attack the dragon enough that it starts to bleed.

Once you know you can make a dent, it's not so scary, but that first movement is psychologically the hardest.
