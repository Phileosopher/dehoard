In 1st Corinthians 11 Paul the super scribe who had been killing people

PAUL THE MOST HUMBLE APOSTLE WHO CALLS HIMSELF LIKE A BLOODY ABORTED APOSTLE…

In 1 Corinthians 11 he says you hold to the traditions of Christ…

The two pieces of literature

MOST RESPECTED

In the entire world.. among all historians..

The most important literature outside of the canonized koine Greek New Testament?

The teaching of The twelve Apostles to the gentiles.. the Didache.

And

Justin martyr's first apology.

There is one

" tradition"

That clearly appears in BOTH of those writings..

"Confess your sins when you gather and do not begin praying if you have a troubled conscience"

" Admit your faults before communion so that your sacrifice is pure"

"We hold an open banquet agape feast for the community…

After everyone is filled..

WE DISMISS ALL VISITORS AND ANYONE WHO HAS NOT BEEN BAPTIZED…

(This is actually where you get the term "Mass" from it's part of the word dismissal.. it's so weird that the term Mass is describing the moment when the visitors go away!)

After all visitors are dismissed the doors are locked and then the time of conscience cleansing revelation of the Holy Spirit and the communion is held..

"Do not allow an unbeliever to even SEE your communion meal"

Okay back to the topic

THE PASTOR… Is the person in our neighborhood who has been revealed by the Holy Spirit..

TO HEAR OUR AFFLICTIONS WEAKNESSES TROUBLES AND STORIES OF OUR BAD SPIRITS…

That person is applying themselves to the care of our souls!

THIS IS NOT A CONGREGATIONAL LEADER

OR AN ORGANIZATIONAL BUSINESS PERSON

WHO IS RUNNING A TEACHING SCHEDULE…

That stuff is the work of a deacon, a business person.

The local Shepherd is a neighborhood person who might not even be a Bible scholar but has the guts to operate in the spirit of Truth.

IF WE HAVE A CONFLICT

We can ask the shepherd of our communion group to take a walk and get some answers from God for us..

SINCE WE HAVE AGREED THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS SELECTED THAT PERSON WE TRUST THEM TO BE A VOICE OF HEAVEN IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AND SKETCHY MATTERS…!
