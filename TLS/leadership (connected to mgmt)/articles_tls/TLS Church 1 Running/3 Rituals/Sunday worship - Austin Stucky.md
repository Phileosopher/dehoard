from Austin Stucky:

A loose definition of Church is merely the assembly of the saints. A more particular definition of Church is Christian Intentional Community.

The Sunday morning gathering was merely intended as the public expression of said community. An outreach program, a time where the Intentional Community of Believers is put on display. An opportunity to intersect with the local community. An opportunity for the general public to get a taste of what happens within the private communal group that does life together.

The epistles of Paul were written to Intentional Communal Groups that were patterned after this model. The Sunday model for church that we've adopted in the west, minus the intentionally of shared community throughout the week is a limited church of no lasting substance.

Private, regular, cloistered communion times where the presence of God is tangibly experienced and the Lord's Supper is administered via the loose oversight and direction of a body of elders becomes the focal point of the week.

In weekly honesty times where sins are confessed, problems are addressed and directed to the Holy Spirit, He answers corporately, not just individually. A private space where unclean spirits operating in the atmospheres of other believers are discerned and addressed via the laying on of hands. Yokes are broken.

The power of God will meet the church in America when she begins to cooperate with God in detaching herself from institutionalized western models of church that present barriers to true fellowship.
