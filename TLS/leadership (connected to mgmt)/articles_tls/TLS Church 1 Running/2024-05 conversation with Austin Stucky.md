Hey Dave. It seems like I've ran into a wall.

The Christian culture at large seems to reject the idea of intentional living. 

There were cults in the Jesus Movement, circa 1970's, but there were also healthy intentional communities (Shiloh Youth Revival Centers being an example)

It's as if we've been so inculcated into this American Dream idea that people are genuinely afraid to entertain a different form of community.

Which I would argue depending on the degree is more true to "church" as portrayed in the Bible than the current form of western churchianity today

But it feels like the matrix movie anytime I bring it up. It's as if people are comfortable with their Christianity as an accessory to their American lifestyle, but as soon as you begin suggesting it as a lifestyle or state of being that transcends it, and start advocating for obedience to Christ in a way that challenges cultural expectations, the group rewards that train of thinking by ignoring you, shaming you, or rejecting you, almost like a sort of defense mechanism or something.

Either I have an understanding of the scripture and church history that compels me towards a particular expression of church that most people find quirky or weird, or the American culture has been part of some kind of cultural psy-op that the powers that be have placed us under in order to discourage and prevent organic biblical fellowships to develop and flourish in this country.

Or both..

Well, to start with, you're in good company: I relate entirely to that surreal experience of facing opposition in asserting Christianity-as-a-mindset over Christianity-as-a-culture, though my particular stories will obviously be different.

If you want to hear my entire view on that, I'll give full disclaimer: it's rather long.

To start with, I'll just lay out a key theological view: we're all destined to fail, often including sin. The Bible makes it abundantly clear, and it saves us a bunch of misery if we can self-identify the particular flavor of sin that we tend to gravitate toward.

Now, to the subject of American culture, I'd like to emphasize some "given" aspects of culture in general. A culture is made of people who decide to follow someone else, meaning that the decision-making disposition of the leaders (and, by association, their personality) has a dramatic effect on how that culture frames itself.

Now, as far as American culture, it's essentially a bunch of antagonistic Protestants who essentially couldn't find a way to live peaceably with the then-omnipresent Catholic Church. They traveled to the New World to get away from their problems, started their own cockamamie ideas (e.g., Pennsylvania, Quakers, et al.), and it took about 2.5 centuries for their rebellious attitude to feed into a coalition with other secular-minded colonies (e.g., Virginia) to politically divide from their nation of origin.

They successfully won that battle, meaning they got a chance to self-define. Their political system was inspired by Christian ideals, mixed with plenty of others (e.g., ancient Roman rule), and that made a society that has to this day endorsed a level of freedom unprecedented in human history.

This freedom, though, has been a type of political "wealth" of its own, and it has corrupted plenty of people in their belief that they have moral license to be jerks.

It's worth noting, though, that they were ALWAYS cantankerous: the colonies were darn unwieldy for Britain to maintain, and governors were officially-not-officially appointed by the colonists just about as much as the Crown.

there was some very legitimate Christian movement  in the first few Evangelical Movements, but it became a post-modern signs-and-wonders spectacle somewhere around the end of the 19th century. Not ALL that way, but that's the beginning of the holy roller type of church.

As political creatures, we are always bound up in both the principles and consequences, and Christian leaders have the job of "shepherding". This means they have to adhere to both the dictates of Way while also considering the motivational aspects of the People. This creates a conflict of interest, naturally, and STRICT adherence is rare.

I'd say that there has been a growing trend, especially starting in post-WWII political America, to create portions of an "ends justify the means" approach to leadership, with a "good enough" solution winning out over what is purely true.

That, also, is an American trait. We are a society of pragmatists, who will throw a quick-and-dirty solution that works today at a problem instead of waiting for the right one tomorrow. Our ambition is our greatest sin.

So, this persists even to today: gotta build a church culture that wins over the most people (and theoretically more believers) over an ideal one.

The thing that sells me on how it doesn't work is that the Body generally sets the goalpost wrong about salvation. We'd have an entirely different attitude to being Christian if we were paying more attention to what our moral state will look like when we expire than what our original conversion experience was.

But, that would require more integration of the shadow (a Jungian psychology term that holds merit here) than most Americans are comfortable with.

However, one piece of wisdom I read from CS Lewis' Screwtape Letters: the experience of war wakes up something moral in people, and the devil therefore must be careful how he uses it.

There is an effort to keep Americans asleep and comfortable. It's the reason I've grown to resent the cultural fixings of the American middle class. The underclass is simply trying to survive, but the middle class is trying to sacrifice all to mammon to attain that lofty goal of becoming part of the upper class.

This isn't to vilify the upper class, either. God allots us the portion we get, and we should be satisfied with it. He gives, and He takes away.

But, that idea isn't exactly acceptable to a rebellious society that found a way to conform to principles of freedom and liberty within that rebellion.

To live in Christ is to become a permanent servant, similar to Deuteronomy 15:16-17. That ideology is foreign to our antagonistic, fiery culture.

I guess what I'm saying, in a nutshell, is that our society isn't ready for the information you're trying to deliver. Individually, they may be, but it'll be lots of "preaching to the choir".

Honestly, most normal average people don't care much about spiritual matters: they're too preoccupied with their own affairs.

Most church leadership don't care because they've been indoctrinated into the denominational flavor they were raised to believe.

The only people who care about a lifestyle of living in Christlike community are, effectively, a minority of people who follow Jesus as a self-determined aspect, not because others share in that sentiment.

I have a friend of mine named Marcin who is moving back into the US soon, I think in Missouri. He's a relatively new believer (software dev at https://github.com/mrcnski). He sees the same crap we both see between culture and identity, and it's been an observation I've seen other new believers note.

God, however, is bigger than this, and He has His ways of making divine coincidences happen. That's why I'm not that worried. If it takes 2 decades, it's His timing and it'll take 2 decades.

Very well stated

I've been looking into the cultural conditions that made the Jesus Movement of the late 70's possible. I find that I draw much inspiration from the Shiloh Youth Revival Centers format of fellowship. Needless to say there were many communal groups that deteriorated into cults. But that one (by the looks of it) was one of the healthier movements, before it eventually dissolved in the 80's

The movement was made up of converted hippies, and my theory is such a lifestyle was possible because of the orientation that they had towards the world prior to their conversion that they retained even after submitting to more conservative ideas

Their "live and let live" attitude, paired with a strong evangelistic approach and a fundamentalist approach to scripture I think was a formidable combo. The problem is that conservatives that hold to similar ideologies today tend to dismiss the more liberal orientation towards society, while the modern descendants of the hippies, have a more biblical orientation but dismiss traditional biblical values

I sorta picture the merger of the two temperaments, hippy love rooted in strong convictions that are biblically informed as similar to what we would find in the early church.

That same hippie temperament fuels the desire to live communally in some form, which I think is also biblical, and something that modern conservatives and society at large also shuns

I figure the negative publicity of the cults over the years and things like the red scare have programmed people to look at communal arrangements skeptically in general

And I'm saying this as someone who generally sympathetic to the capitalist  model on the macro scale. I'm just seeing how certain forms of communalism can be beneficial for a lot of people in this current climate, but I'm uncertain if a movement like that would really take off today in this country like it did then

## Me

I'm resonating much with what you're saying. My millennial kingdom essay was essentially articulating that idea: the reign of Jesus on earth will include a self-drive that looks a lot like capitalism, but toward motivations that are selfless in nature (like communism claims to advance).

I think your uncertainty is largely true. The American spirit is centered heavily in individualism, and the current pressure of the fashions is antagonistic to that sort of thinking.

If you think about it, the Christlike way to submit to Caesar may well mean that you give up your guns and right to free speech if the authorities ask for it. However, the "right" thing to do in this country is to sue the crap out of everyone.

Passive resistance in Christ is a fine line, which boils down to "I do not like what you're doing, but respect that God gave you that authority, so please be careful with your power."

So, that fine line veers into 2 political extremes when you get the Unwashed involved:
1. Pure, rebellious resistance: fight The Man.
2. Pure, mindless submission: line up and take it.

The irony is that #2 there has led to Nazi Germany, and #1 has led to COVID-19, so people more remember that one, and would more quickly oppose everyone.

In other words, if we hadn't had a worldwide shutdown by the powers-that-be, people would be more willing to trust their institutions.

Though, this trend has been degrading for a while. Gallup indicated in 2016 that institutional trust was at 37%, and it's something like 17% right now.

The problem is that communal living requires a certain amount of "institutional" trust, since it requires someone to manage various things (like insurance contracts or bookkeeping or logistics), and that makes a 1-person institution of that specialization, even if it's as decentralized as possible.

Now, I'm not saying it's a lost cause, but to affirm that the ideas you're proposing are antithetical to mainline thinking.

However, if you have a legitimate vision, working toward that idea is not a bad thing.

I have a personal theory that there's a cloak that hides the complete consequences of our actions from our perception, meaning we have to act in faith.

I know for a fact that Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, and John Adams would be mortified at the political issues of today. I'm also convinced Christian leaders like John Calvin and Charles Spurgeon would be amazed at the scope of their influence.

This is all to say that we simply must do what we must do, then watch God create the consequences. If people think it's a cult, that's none of their business.

Actually, that's a standard practice for Christians: being misunderstood.

The early Christians had a 3-stage church experience on Sunday:
1. a public assembly
2. The Peace, which was an unstructured time for about an hour and a half to reconcile your sins with others
3. a closer gathering, which involved commucharist as well.

The "Love Feast" was very private. They also happened to celebrate at the tomb of Christians who died, since it was a victorious celebration of moving on in life.

Those things together meant that some Romans thought they were cannibals.

I wrote an essay on cults (https://gainedin.site/cults). We're currently so independently-minded (especially political conservatives) that it's likely they'll call you a pinko commie simply for believing in hippie ideals.

I'd say that it's not a cult if you make sure it a proper system. Make a nod to the rest of the "institutions", like Bruderhoff, and it'll simply make people uncomfortable enough to ask questions.
