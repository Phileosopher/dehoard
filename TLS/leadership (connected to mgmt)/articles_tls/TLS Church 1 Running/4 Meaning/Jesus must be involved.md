If Jesus launched His ministry today, most of us wouldn’t follow Him.
Let me prove it:
🟡 He had no title — He wasn’t a pastor, bishop, or apostle. We’d question His legitimacy and authority because He didn’t come through the ranks or wear the titles we respect.
🟡 He was only 3 years in ministry — We'd say He wasn't seasoned enough to lead or “cover” anyone.
🟡 He was unmarried and childless — So we’d say He lacked the understanding or experience to speak on marriage, parenting, or family matters.
🟡 He only had 12 followers — And one of them betrayed Him. We'd call that poor leadership and say He lacked discernment.
🟡 He didn’t launch a church — He taught in borrowed spaces—homes, synagogues, hillsides. We'd call Him unstable, unestablished, and illegitimate.
🟡 He had no ordination — No license. No certificate. No spiritual father to co-sign His calling. We’d call Him rebellious or rogue for operating without formal covering or denominational approval.
🟡 He flipped tables and challenged religious systems — We’d label Him bitter, divisive, and disrespectful. We’d likely even say He had a spirit of offense and needed deliverance.
🟡 He healed on the Sabbath — He didn’t follow protocol. He didn’t ask for permission. He didn’t wait for the right setting. We’d accuse Him of being out of order and dishonoring spiritual authority.
🟡 He said He heard directly from God — We’d call Him unsubmitted, spooky, or dangerous. We might even say things like "he's hearing from a spirit but not the holy spirit"
Truth is…
Our traditions would’ve told Jesus to sit down.
Religion would’ve told Him to go submit under a seasoned leader.
And much of the Church would’ve disqualified Him before He ever preached the Kingdom.
The same Jesus we'll be preaching and crying about the next few weeks wouldn’t be welcomed if He walked in today.
(And before anyone flips the narrative—this isn’t bashing the Church. I am, however, questioning some of our norms.)
I do want us to be reminded: Jesus came to establish a Kingdom—not validate a system. And the Kingdom was disruptive in every way to the systems of His time.
Sometimes, disruption is the doorway to revival and realignment.
We don’t need more polish. We don’t need more titles. And we don’t need more platforms. We do need more power, more truth, and more presence.
May we have eyes to see Him—even when He shows up in ways we don’t expect.  The courage to follow—even when it breaks our traditions to do it. And an ear to hear—even when His voice confronts what we’ve built in His name.
God is kind.
