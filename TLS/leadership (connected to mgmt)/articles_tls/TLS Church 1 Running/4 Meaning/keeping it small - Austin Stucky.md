
The spark notes version is.. the communion groups are centered around the belief that there is tangible power in the communion table as one of the primary means that God uses to form Christ in us individually and corporately and that fellowship gatherings should be done around that meal as the focal point within closed private gatherings.

Following a time of personal confession (just as the OT priest would read off the sin list of the people before the slaying of the lamb at the Passover Seder) and the discerning of individual demons that are afflicting group members around the table. That's affectionally known as "conscious cleansing time" or the "discerning of the body" before the meal per 1 Cor 11.

The substance of what defines the "church" is in the home gatherings of the handful of families who regularly meet as well as the singles who join themselves to the families. Each individual home group then selects a family man who has a proclivity towards the watching over of men's souls who is nominated as an over shepherd. Then these regular home groups collectively come together once a week on Sunday morning for an act of public worship where curious people can get a taste of what the community is all about and be immersed into the different home groups all of which have their own distinct flavor.

The idea being that this is the original structure that God instituted for men to appropriate the cleansing and atonement for sin, and keep one's soul undefiled and protected against afflicting unclean spirits.

And then he's got a bunch of fun ideas on the side that he thought up that helps encourage honest conversations within community that aren't necessarily biblical per se, but can be useful pointers in pursuit of fulfilling Christian relationships within the brotherhood/sisterhood

The idea is that each home group cluster would have one or two Christian businesses birthed out of them that would allow for the men to work together and their wife's to gather together regularly and assist in childcare, homeschooling etc etc

that'sâ€¦surprisingly similar to what I've been discovering

again, semantic differences, but the concept is that the core functionality of the Church would be in a small environment, centered on a scant few traditions

mine seems to be more organization-focused, with the idea being that each group (i.e., housechurch) has its own freedom to individuate their style on MANY things, and scaling means breaking off new housechurches more than getting any larger building

The public gathering would be the coming together of the individual groups where visitors could get a "taste" of the corporate fellowship and subsequently could be invited to any of the individual home gatherings afterwards to experience a taste of communal life. Being politely excused before the communion table

And the visitors would have their choice in whatever home group environment setting that they felt most comfortable settling into which would help facilitate regular confession.

Each group with their own niche like you stated

And a loose doctrinal structure that ties them all together
