
Upon receiving the enablement of the Holy Spirit a believer grows
very sensitive to his spirit's senses. He should keep his inner man
continually free, allowing the Holy Spirit to flow out His life in and
through his being. To keep the inner man free is to maintain it in an
operative condition for the Holy Spirit. Suppose God, for instance,
sends a believer to lead a meeting. This one's spirit must be open. He
should not come to the meeting with a spirit loaded down with many
cares or weights, else this shall afflict the whole meeting with
heaviness, creating a difficult and unbearable situation. The one who
leads should not carry his burden to the meeting and expect the
congregation to set him free. Anyone who relies on the response of
the congregation to relieve him of his burden is doomed to failure.
When he enters the meeting place the leader's spirit must be light
and unbound. Many who attend are teeming with burdens. Hence the
leader first must release them through prayer, hymn, or truth before
he can deliver God's message. He cannot expect to unshackle others
while he is himself bound with unbroken fetters.

A spiritual Christian can no longer enjoy the anointing of the
Spirit in a work that has become mechanical. When a task is already
given up by God as unnecessary and yet is maintained by the
Christian because of the outside organization (with or without form)
which surrounds it, then it must be carried on by drawing upon his
own resources rather than upon the power of God. Should a saint
persist in laboring after the spiritual work is terminated, he must
employ his soul power as well as physical power to continue on with
it. In true spiritual service one must completely deny his natural
talent and gift; only in this way can he produce fruit for God. If not,
each effort not led by the Holy Spirit does collapse if not supported
by one's brain, talent, or gift.

A worker must observe carefully which part of his labor the Holy
Spirit anoints. Then he will be able to cooperate with Him and
operate within the current of His power. The worker's duty is to
discern the current of the Spirit and to follow it. A task should be
discontinued if it no longer enjoys God's anointing, is out of His
current, and creates a sluggish, languid feeling. Another undertaking
should be found which flows with the current. The spiritual man
discerns more quickly than others. The matter for him to determine
is, where is the Holy Spirit's current? Where is it flowing? Any labor
that oppresses spiritual life, that fails to express the life of the spirit,
or that hinders God's Spirit from overflowing has become a definite
obstacle, however well it began. That work should be either
cancelled or corrected so that the believer can obey life in the spirit.
The worker may have to alter his relationship to the work.
