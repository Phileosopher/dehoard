
From a financial standpoint, running a church should NOT be hard:
- At 10% of everyone's income, a fulltime pastor would only need donations from 10 people who gave 10% of THEIR income (15 people if we're talking post-tax donations)
- administrative overhead is another requirement, but it's generally proportional to the relative size needs of the congregation
- if they're not giving enough, provide more transparency about the where the money goes, _especially_ to the fringe non-core Body
