Conventionally, venues can be volunteered by Christians or acquired much more affordably. Campuses like churches, colleges, movie theaters, parks, and clubs are all acceptable.

Further, the internet's ubiquity can magnify remote centers. Get hosts to volunteer their home and connect via conference call, telecast from a larger venue onto satellite venues, have group meetings where each location shares one screen for dialogue and feedback.

There are many other options nobody has thought of or, at least, talked about. The collective creativity is all in the brains of the people who run things, but they have to see a motivation to consider doing it over the conventional way.
