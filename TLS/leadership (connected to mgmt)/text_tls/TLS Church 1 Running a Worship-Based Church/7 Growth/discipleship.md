- Spiritual mentors are leaders, even by secular standards.

Legitimate Christians show specific characteristics, and THEY should be the ones running the Church:
1. They confess Jesus is God's Son ([Romans 10:9](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/rom.10.9), [1 Corinthians 12:3](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1co.12.3)).
2. Their lifestyle consistently [changes](https://gainedin.site/changes/) as they discover new truths.
3. They [love others](https://gainedin.site/love/) through the Holy Spirit working on them.
    - While love isn't always intimacy, it's an authentic concern for others' well-being.
4. They're developing a solid spiritual [doctrine](https://gainedin.site/philosophy/), even when they believe some false teachings.

The "leadership" of the Church is the people: the unwashed new believers and inexperienced members
- the ministers are supposed to serve them, which requires a certain selflessness that can't be reproduced otherwise
- to falsely reproduce it is to have a silly, self-flagellating humble-down: "I am the worst", "No, IIII am the greatest of all sinners"
