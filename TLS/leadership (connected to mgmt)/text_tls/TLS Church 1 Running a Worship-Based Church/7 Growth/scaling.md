
THEOLOGOS CHURCH ADMIN
- Churches scale like any other organization, with a once-a-month two-minute task for a pastor slowly adapting to a full-time job for one person.
- The Launch Big model is a high-cost growth strategy that reflects secular non-profit organizations.

One of the reasons the Christian Church suffers is that it uses all the tactics from NPOs (check GIS Influence under "Abuse" regarding giving resources, and paraphrase)

Large-scale laws were designed for large-scale society
- the Bible is absolutely silent on how to run large-scale society, likely because [His kingdom] hasn't come yet
