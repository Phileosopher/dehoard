
The Christian message SHOULD be simple:
- Live with eternity and "now" in mind
- Devote your effort fully to His cause, then dovetail all things into it
- Hand off responsibility as much as others wish to shoulder the burden and have the spiritual authority to do so
- (however, this isn't practiced because most Christian leadership aren't entirely aware of what they're leading or how)

When you hold events, make sure to NOT constantly advertise other events
- modern [American Christianity] is built around [constantly getting people to the venue](https://icould.fail/marketing)
- however, it doesn't respect that each person's life is a dynamic and involved experience
- if you want to run a church correctly, consistently cross-promote things that are NOT in your influence (e.g., community center events from other nonprofits, other churches' activities from other denominations)
    - and, to go further, get involved and work alongside OTHER groups that started certain things (e.g., don't start a homeless clothing drive if another church 2 miles away already has been doing one)
