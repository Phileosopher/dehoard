
One huge component of this domain is the aspect of WHERE authority comes from:
- We all agree it comes from God, but how it travels means everything.
- A.it could come from our compliance
- B. it could come from our granted position.
- it's ABSOLUTELY critical in the 10% event that the person is NOT behaving according to their position (e.g., the ignoble king, the unrighteous pope).
- Protestants and Americans lean into compliance, Catholics and Europeans lean into position

Even outside Christianity this holds weight. The sciences, for example, have many specializations, and each one has their own pedantic view about things that is technically correct, but only in their domain. Their specialization blinds them.

I'm convinced most denominations come from various niches we naturally form ourselves into. What he's saying is very true.

In these times, most people who discover this have 3 choices:
- 1. Make a new denomination, and "do it right" this time, adding 1 more of them to the pile.
- 2. Start a parachurch organization where they can do the most good.
- 3. Quietly work inside a denomination still because that's where they can best serve.

There's very little consensus on what makes the "right" culture, for several reasons:
1. That culture will honor things that may not be what the other people in that culture like. The other people will disagree over that minor thing as if it were a major thing (e.g., choice of music) and miss the unifying point entirely.
2. We only find meaning if we determine the qualifications of an ideal culture ourselves, and bestowing that specific meaning to others that we've found will make others question it at best and reject it at worst.
3. Even if we could convince everyone of conforming to a culture, we veer into the risk of creating a cult if there's no new information to continue churning around in the group that fosters change.
