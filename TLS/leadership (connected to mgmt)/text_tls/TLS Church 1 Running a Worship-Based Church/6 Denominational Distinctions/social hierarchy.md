
The cultural power dynamics of a church group create a normative model that represents itself universally across almost any major church that respects a clergy/laity dichotomy:
- Level 0 - non-believers who may attend regularly
- Level 1 - claimed believers who don't identify with the church or only show up sporadically
- Level 2 - claimed believers who attend service regularly (i.e., 1+ meeting/week)
- Level 3 - claimed believers who have made a public declaration of their faith (i.e., membership or baptism)
    - Some churches (e.g., Calvary Chapel) don't use Level 3
- Level 4 - actively involved in publicly established lay-ministry semi-regularly (i.e., at least once every 1-3 months)
- Level 5 - actively involved in established lay-ministry very regularly or formally confirmed as a lay-minister (i.e., at least monthly)
- Level 6 - formally declared a mid-level or higher-order lay-minister or appointed as leader of a ministry
    - Most church leadership is Level 6 and higher
- Level 7 - formally declared an elder/church board member
- Level 8 - ordained as a pastor

Most evangelical churches lean heavy into Level 0 becoming Level 1 and Level 1 becoming Level 5.

Catholics tend to lean into making Level 2 into Level 5.

Nobody ever seems to work well with highly qualified outsiders (e.g., have the authority to become Level 6 from overseas missionary work in a different denomination).
