
Assuming they're still present, tongues and prophecy should be managed correctly:
- God made tongues for unbelievers and prophecy for believers ([1 Corinthians 14:22](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1co.14.22)).
- Tongues always had a recipient who understood it when they heard it ([Acts 2](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/act.2)).
- An entire church that speaks in tongues together instead of one by one is running a church incorrectly ([1 Corinthians 14:40](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1co.14.40)).
