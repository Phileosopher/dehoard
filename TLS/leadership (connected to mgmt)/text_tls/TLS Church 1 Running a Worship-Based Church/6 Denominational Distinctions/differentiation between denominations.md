Things Catholics hold and differentiate Catholics & Protestants:
- Papal infallibility
- Purgatory
- Petrine primacy
- Petrine universal jurisdictions
- FILIOQUE

The fact is that the precepts that guide the Church within Scripture are VERY culture-agnostic.
- this allows a LOT of interpretation about pretty much everything.

The cultural value of Protestants to insist on the surrounding culture to adopt their ways (e.g., "we live in a Christian nation") is a relic of the Catholic church's imposition from their political control of everything
- I'm no so sure about this now...

Break apart the components by denomination
- Soteriology
- Eschatology
- Homiletics
- Orthodoxy
- Heterodoxy
- Maybe call it a "religious jargon dictionary"
