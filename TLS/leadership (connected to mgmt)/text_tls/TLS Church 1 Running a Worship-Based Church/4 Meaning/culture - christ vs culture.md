Jesus [confronts](https://adequate.life/conflicts/) every believer to change, which creates an [inherent conflict](https://icould.fail/devotion-chaos/) with the world's [culture](https://gainedin.site/culture/).

Christians frequently disagree on _how_ to integrate their existing [culture](https://gainedin.site/culture/) with His requirements.

Christ Against Culture - At the farthest extreme, some believers claim that Jesus is directly against all culture and rejects any cultural associations.
- The idea proposes doing away with _all_ old cultural elements.
- Famous examples include Mennonites and some Pentecostal groups.
- This stance is purist, but [irrational](https://gainedin.site/logic/) in this age since people can't _entirely_ remove their old way of life without something [new to replace it](https://icould.fail/millennium/), and the Bible's standards are broad enough to permit most Christians to keep their culture while conforming to God's standard.

Christ of Culture - At the other extreme, other believers claim that there is _no_ conflict because the Gospel brings people more into their natural culture.
- The idea proposes seeking a respectable reputation and a good life are ideal.
- Famous examples include the Gnostics and liberal Christianity (which is arguably not Christian).
- Since [persecution](https://icould.fail/persecution/) is the culture rejecting believers, and the entire New Testament is _filled_ with persecution, this view is unbiblical ([1 Peter 4](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1pe.4)).

Christ Above Culture - Some believers merge both views and say that Jesus is working through both the Church and culture.
- This idea states that God is operating through everything, even secular or evil things.
- Popular examples include the Roman Catholics and Orthodox churches.
- Irrespective of how far it goes, God _can_ and often _does_ use anything for His [purposes](https://gainedin.site/purpose/) ([Romans 8:28](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/rom.8.28)).

Christ and Culture in Paradox - Some believers believe God created the world's culture before it was tainted.
- One popular example is the early American Puritans.
- Since all good things come from God, Christians in this view accept some elements of mainstream culture and reject others by whether they're deemed good.
- Taken broadly, this would mean God is restoring society [back to His original plan](https://theologos.site/millennium/).

Christ the Culture Transformer - Some believers conclude that since Jesus is redeeming all humanity, Christians should rehabilitate all cultures to God's perfect plan.
- Most Reformed groups in the Protestant Reformation have believed it.
- This belief guides Christians to convert their culture toward a perfect end.
- Taken far enough, this would then become advancing for [social justice](https://gainedin.site/leftism/), which _is_ unbiblical.

Christ the Culture Alternative - Some believers contend that they're building a brand-new culture altogether that the world will [adopt](https://gainedin.site/trends/).
- Most modern churches adhere to this idea.
- Their reasoning is that a Christian should show the perfect culture the world can either adopt or reject.
- However, this implies that there is a "[new](https://gainedin.site/image/)" culture that isn't merely a [remix](https://gainedin.site/creations/) of previous cultures.

NOTE: THIS ENTIRE IDEA WAS POSITED AS AN ANTHROPOLOGY-LEANING SECULAR THOUGHT EXPERIMENT
- IN REALITY, IT'S KINDA ALL OF THEM, WITH THE GROUPS BEING PLANS OF PRIORITIZATION MORE THAN DEMARCATED GROUPS
