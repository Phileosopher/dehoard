
There are 3 generally irreconcilable priorities that every individual (and, as a result, every church) must resolve in some prioritization:
- Intuition (i.e., trusting the Holy Spirit and/or your soul's unspoken sensations)
- Theology (i.e., philosophical beliefs pertaining to God and how to live)
- Tradition (i.e., habits bestowed by the culture of the people around you)

These are all good in their time and place, but they all present risks:
- Too much intuition creates a wishy-washy experience that's barely Christianity
- Too little intuition stifles any chance for the Holy Spirit to work
- Too much theology alienates the "least of these" (i.e., the lower-intelligence members of the Body)
- Too little theology means no clear guidance on things that God was explicitly clear on
- Too much tradition means no chance for social change, even when it's literally the most ethical thing to do
- Too little tradition means no cultural solidarity from familiar shared activities
