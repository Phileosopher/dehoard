"John MacArthur, noted author and pastor of Grace Community Church in Los Angeles, California, has remarked, 'I can tell the depth of any church spiritually after being in their worship service for only five minutes.' When asked to explain, he replied, 'If the words of the music are unusually experience-oriented, man-centered, me-focused, and so fast-paced that the service more resembles a pep rally than a worship service, that church is, more than likely, shallow and superficial.' Then MacArthur expounded, 'You must first take a church down deep in the Word if you would lead them up high in worship. The depth determines the height. The depth in the Word determines the height in worship. Shallowness in the Word leads to shallowness in worship. Too many churches try to fake it simply by turning up the volume.' This is a correct analysis, an accurate diagnosis that the contemporary church needs to hear and heed today." - Steve Lawson

With the prophesy of Daniel being fulfilled before us, especially in light of the internet age, many running to and fro, and knowledge increasing on the earth.
Will the diligent researchers and teachers among us be able to come to a solid understanding and universal agreement concerning Apostolic Teaching & Church Polity?
That will not only continue to expose the errors within the institutional frameworks handed down to us through past ages..
But compel those adventurous souls who share a common love of the truth, to detach themselves from the comfortable and familiar networks that they were raised in, to venture out into the unknown to be part of the restoration of the original ekklesia that God intended to grace the earth?
