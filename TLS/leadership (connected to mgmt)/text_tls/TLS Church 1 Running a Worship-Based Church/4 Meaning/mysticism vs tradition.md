
One of the problems is that mysticism (which is HIGHLY relative) very rapidly becomes tradition as other people imitate it.

However, to be Christian, you do NOT need to have anything mystical within the experience. It's a matter of knowing a rudimentary fact, and then acting in light of that rudimentary fact.

Any mysticism is personality imposed into the experience, but it's the basis for every single Christian sect, since the Bible is a bit sparse on traditions, and nature (even human nature) abhors a vacuum.
