there is a class of person who is highly needy
- that person has needs that, if unmet, would mean severe [hardship] for them
- the exact needs they have, to the degree that they are legitimately needs, must be taken care of
- it is literally the most un-Christ-like behavior to deny them those basic needs
however, in that class of person, there is a significant subset of people who don't solve problems on their own
- that person has been trained to rely solely on everyone else, even when they have the means to fix a problem themselves
evidence that this may be happening:
- repeated requests for the exact same thing
- increased requests on top of existing requests for a routine thing
- no indication of a routine need being self-met
when you help a person who is perfectly capable of helping themselves, you rob them of [meaning]
- your sacrifice may be intentionally selfless, but it's not free and they're treating it like it is
- the [contractual](boundaries) nature of how human interaction works means their dependence on you incurs a form of [debt] or [slavery] on your behalf, even if it's not explicit
- you can continually forgive that "debt", and that is gracious, but your sacrifice towards them also comes with the opportunity cost of no means to sacrifice to others
- we are called to love others AS ourselves, meaning we are responsible to let people experience at least a portion of the logical consequences of their decisions
therefore, if a person tries to rely on you too much:
1. give them specifically what they need, but do not give them enough that it moves into the domain of wants
2. place healthy boundaries about how you believe they are capable individuals who can solve the problem themselves
3. communicate to everyone who may be in contact with them all of the above
- without this, loving communities will become embittered over giving, then eventually stingy
if this person utilizes shame in any way, any of the following lines will break the cycle:
- "I've noticed, as well as many others here (if applicable) that you keep needing the same things. Is there any way you can resolve these issues yourself?"
- "I know that (problem) is very significant, but I also believe you are capable to handle it. What parts of it do you want to assist with?"
- "We really want to help you, but it takes effort out of our lives to do it. How can you help us back?"
- "I really don't want to rob you of your meaning or interfere with your journey in Christ. How can we help you in a way that allows you to reap the consequences of your decisions?"
evidence that this may be happening:
- repeated requests for the exact same thing
- increased requests on top of existing requests for a routine thing
- no indication of a routine need being self-met
ironically, when church leadership steps in to communicate these things, they behave as paternalistically as the members who asked for their help on that matter
- if Person A is being overly needy on Person B, Person C is being unwise to tangle with the issue (PRoverbs 26:17)
