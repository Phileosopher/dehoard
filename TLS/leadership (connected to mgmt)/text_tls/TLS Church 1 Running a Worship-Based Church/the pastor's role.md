eph 4:11-12
 So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12 to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up
the role of a pastor is to equip, and not necessarily anymore to be a "minister" as much as the actual Body
