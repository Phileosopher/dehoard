## FROM NO AGENDA Social

Hey Adam,
I've just listening to the latest podcast and I wanted to give insight about evangelical Christianity. Lol first of all John was way off base. Evangelical Christianity is not connected to a denomination essentially any Christianity of any denomination can be an evangelical. Most churches even have a mix of evangelical and non evangelical Christians. However some denominations and some churches have a higher percentage of evangelicals. To determine if someone is an evangelical they need to ascribe to 4 principals.
First is that they had a conversion experience, which means they can point towards a specific time where they decided to die to the world and start living for Christ.
Second, they must believe in sola scriptura, which means that they believe that the Bible is the divinely inspired word of God, and the Bible is the sole authority not church leaders.
Third they must live with a Biblical world view in their daily life and evangelize to non-Christians.
Lastly, they must believe, that humans are inherently sinful, that Jesus' death on the cross was an atoning sacrifice that cleanses us from sin, and that his sacrifice is the only thing that can save us, not good works.
Thanks for all that you do,
Luke

---

creeds were originally designed as memorizable mnemonics that non-literate Christians could pass information onward with

Polycarp - taught by Paul
Ignatius - taught by John?
Clement of Rome - 4th bishop of Rome
bishops were appointed by apostles
- apostolic succession
- the bishops were a traditionally established maintainer of the faith, through the laying on of hands
- bishop means "overseer", and they were responsible to [manage] and curate the Church on doctrinal matters
- episcopas in Greek is not in Christian doctrine, and it was part of the administration of the Christian church
