Statement of Things I Do Not Believe
Steve Blackwell (abridged & modified by Austin Stucky)

I am afraid that I am not convinced of the value of an "official" Statement of Faith, which can leave out as much as it puts in. While many ministries have carefully crafted statements of faith that comply with Biblical doctrine, in practice, many of them do NOT preach a sound gospel message of salvation. I have read more than one such statement, which sounded like it could have been penned by the archangel Michael himself. However, a closer inspection or listening of their words and life revealed much malarkey, none of which definitively contradicted their declaration, (Which should have ended with the words... "and then some").

Bearing this in mind I prefer to list what I DO NOT believe. Ignoring the finer points of English grammar, the words "I DO NOT BELIEVE" can be substituted with "THE BIBLE DOES NOT TEACH."

Please Note: That I, as a Christian, cannot belong to any man-made denomination, regularly attend any 21st Century Church, or subscribe to any man-made creed. (What is a Reformed Evangelical Anyway?). If you wish to hang a label on me, the word "Christian" will do very well. I owe everything I have and everything I am to Christ Jesus alone.

I DO NOT believe that all religions are valid paths to the same destination, or that Jesus was just a good man and a wise teacher. He was, and is, God Almighty whose return isn't far away.

I DO NOT believe that any man can adequately explain God's nature and being. Our understanding of God has been elevated to the place of untouchable orthodoxy. Scripture is content to make it clear that God (Yahweh) is God, Jesus is God, and The Holy Spirit is also God, without explaining how this is so, or what the exact relationship is between the Three.

I DO NOT believe that there is any logical or Biblical reason why a sovereign God, by His sovereign design, could not allow creatures made in His image the freedom of genuine moral choice, or that He is unable to keep that which He desires. 

I DO NOT believe that Christianity is simply a matter of reciting the sinner's prayer or that anyone who has once believed is saved regardless of what they do afterward. Salvation came to us at a great price and without holiness, no one will see heaven. Subordinating all worldly and personal ambitions to Him is the very essence of the Christian faith. 

I DO NOT believe that baptism is necessary for salvation. However, all believers must be baptized, it is an integral part of the Gospel and a command of Christ, yet some were not baptized. 

I DO NOT believe that speaking in tongues is (necessarily) the initial evidence of the infilling of the Holy Spirit or that everyone should speak in tongues.

I DO NOT believe in Inclusivism, Universalism, Ecumenism, or Interfaith-ism. 

I DO NOT believe that someone who does not persevere in the faith and does not continue to be obedient to the will of God will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Much as some would like to believe otherwise... if you fall away and live in sin... you will NOT be saved. However, it is not necessarily true that every believer who commits any sin will lose salvation every time he sins. 

I (am not convinced) that today's popular feel-good revivals are genuine. The test of true revival is that it changes the moral climate of a person or community. 

I DO NOT believe that children's Scriptural knowledge should be left up to Sunday School and Youth Groups, too many of whom are dedicated to having fun. "They are too young to understand such things" is the devil's argument to deter parents from discharging their duty. 

I DO NOT believe that women should not teach.* (However, women should not be pastors). 

I DO NOT believe in The Contemporary/Commercial Church which is light on doctrine and heavy on music and drama.*

I DO NOT believe in the Emerging Church, Seeker Sensitive Church, or the New Age Church which is, in many cases, doing little but re-merging with Catholicism and adopting practices learned from Buddhism and Hinduism. 

I DO NOT believe that Christians should be playing footsie with New Age beliefs (depending on how that term is defined), Yoga, walking Labyrinths, or indulging in mystical practices.*

I DO NOT believe that a Christian should have anything to do with Halloween, astrology, dowsing, Ouija boards, Reiki, Shamanism, people who claim to communicate with the dead, the likes of Harry Potter, or any other kind of psychic phenomena. 

I DO NOT believe in the New Ecumenism, nor should a Christian be a member of the Masonic Lodge.

I DO NOT believe that the sign gifts have been done away with, nor do I believe that every third person is a prophet. Furthermore, I do not believe in New Revelation* (technically), but that God has and does sometimes give special revelation/understanding to accomplish His purposes. 

I DO NOT believe that the Prayer of Jabez is a magic formula or that the so-called Bible codes are anything but random chance. 

I DO NOT believe that Homosexuality is just an alternative lifestyle and that Abortion and Divorce are simply matters of choice. (God abhors all three). 

I DO NOT believe that people should be playing God. Euthanasia, Cloning, and Stem cell research, among other things, should be strongly opposed by all Christians.

I DO NOT believe that anyone knows every single detail of end times events and certainly not the exact chronological order, we all know the outcome but for the present, there are plenty of life and death issues at hand. However, I do believe that the church had better prepare itself to go through the tribulation. 

I DO NOT believe that Christians should be involved in government or any of its processes* (in general) i.e., war, jury duty, judging and condemning, voting, pledging allegiance to a flag, etc., but should live peacefully within the bounds of the existing government God has set-up and submit to any of it wishes that do not oppose the wishes of their own King and Governor. 

I reserve the right to add to or take from the list above as I am led by the Holy Spirit and given more understanding. I am quite sure that many more things could be added, but this is a good start.

NOTE: THIS MAY BE GOOD FOR ME TO REPRODUCE FOR MYSELF AS A SEPARATE PAGE
