
Episcopal Church: "I was saved 2,000 years ago when Jesus was on the cross, I am being saved, and I hope to be saved."
- Salvation is simultaneously something that has already happened and is currently happening for them.
- It's probably the best way to look at it:
    - Caths focus on "will be"
    - Prots focus on "are" (with Calvinists on "was")
