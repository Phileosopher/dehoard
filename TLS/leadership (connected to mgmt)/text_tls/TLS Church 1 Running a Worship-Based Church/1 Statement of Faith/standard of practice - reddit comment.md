From my own [essay-writing](https://gainedin.site/groups-large) and research, I've realized that human interaction has a hard limit of generating meaning for the individuals in it of up to ~150 people. By that point, the only way it really scales is through the emergent order of subdivisions within that larger entity. This applies to all domains: management, distribution of services, city planning, etc.

In Christ, my expectation is that the growth should develop with a _hyper_-obsession with ensuring meaning is maintained with the members. This can be difficult (what with the [range of personalities](https://gainedin.site/personality/) we all possess), but is absolutely critical for the preservation of all souls involved.

I'm still writing it out and a few months out from getting to it, but my own informal abstractive mechanism involves the following solution:

1. Grow without provocation toward numbers, focusing on quality > quantity.
2. At approximately 50-70 people but never more than 100, force a divide (e.g., break a chunk of people off into a new church plant in the area, send off some people to another region, etc.).
3. As the other one grows, nurture it to a point, but leave it _very_ hands-off, including but not limited to permitting an entire denominational shift with that new church's culture. The only interaction should be on the basis of need or for collaborative actions (i.e., avoid centralized management).
4. With the exception of heresy, let whatever happens happen!

This is a complete abdication of power, and most pastors are inherently territorial, so I doubt it'll ever happen. But, that's the rough draft of what I'll be essaying on once I get a few other prerequisite essays finished in a few other domains.
