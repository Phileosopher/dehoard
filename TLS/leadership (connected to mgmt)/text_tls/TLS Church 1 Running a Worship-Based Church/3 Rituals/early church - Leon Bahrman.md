What is missed in modern Christianity is the organic nature of the early Church.

What we're used to in our day is the institutional and denominational aspects of Christian expression. And while early traditions have been encapsulized in her sacraments (such as baptism and the eucharist), many things have been lost.

Some organic aspects that some recapture today, but the Church as a whole could do well to relearn are:

1. The close fellowship of home gatherings;
2. The 'love-feast' of sharing meals together;
3. An intimate experience of the divine expressed in ways that are only shared between you and God;
4. The physical contact of laying on of hands, as in healing services;
5. A timelessness in worship, sharing with eternity an abandonment of heart and soul, where no one is looking at their watches;
6. A humility of leadership where the 'greatest among you' is servant of all; And..
7. A sense of family where we can open up to each other, support each other, and pray one for another.

That's just a few things that come readily to my mind. What do you think the early Church had that we could use or incorporate in our church-experience?
