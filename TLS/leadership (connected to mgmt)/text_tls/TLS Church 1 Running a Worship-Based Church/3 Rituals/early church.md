1. Casual greeters at the narthex before entering.
2. 1-2 modern-ish worship songs being performed.
3. Often, announcements listed off, which often include births/deaths, and often including baptism rituals.
4. 2-4 more modern-ish worship songs performed in the interlude.
5. 15-90 minutes of an expositional or topical homily.
6. Often an evangelistic "altar call" near the end of the service (aka a "Come to Jesus" message), often merged with the ending song's performance.
7. One benediction-style ending song, but often emphasizing solemnity, often including the Lord's Supper/Eucharist, and a formal dismissal.
