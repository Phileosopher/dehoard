Communion/Eucharist

- can be interpreted as "the" blood and human flesh, or symbolizing it
- like in the Gospel accounts, can be taken in either order
- some people conflate John 6 with the event itself, but it's a ritual to HONOR salvation, not a prerequisite
- the first Church had an actual _meal_ with ritual bread and then-normative-and-diluted wine
    - Thus, Paul's Corinthians letter referred to people being forbidden to eat with the rest of the people
        - Paul admonishes them to eat their nice meal beforehand to not create inequality with the poorer believers
- IDEA: as long as it's sanctified, can be cookies/sweetbread and grape soda/koolaid
    - However, to be purist, you do want bread without yeast (i.e., saltines)
- IDEA: the Eucharist is an addition to the Passover seder, but Jesus could have chosen anything
    - He chose the wine as a symbolic representation of what people used it for: functional, practical, adult enjoyment
    - This means that the solemnity of the Eucharist is probably overblown
- The Protestant view is to repent unconfessed sin before taking it, but that's a Catholic tradition crossover, and Paul NEVER talked about it
    - It's simply the Passover meal with an additional ritual
    - The worser sin in the Corinthian church was to get drunk or forbid people to eat with them (i.e., unloving/divisive)
- There's nothing really "mystical" about the Eucharist/Lord's Supper!
