Hi!

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "traditions".

As a BAPTIST, from EASTERN CANADA, who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s, in mostly English language
urban life - I have church traditions that reflect those things.
These range from architecture, arrangement of the sanctuary, language
used in the pulpit, musical styles, professional expectations, church
management, church government, theological perspectives and so much
more.

To me, traditions are the
habits we get into by accident and by planning, and we stay with them
because they give easy answers to practical needs.

To use a "non church example", Alcoholics Anonymous has "12 steps and [12 traditions](https://www.aa.org/the-twelve-traditions).

> The
> Twelve Traditions provide guidelines for relationships between the

> Traditions.

With that understanding of traditions and their purpose, lets look at a few.

- Architecture - most Baptists understand their "church building" as a more of a
    "meeting house" than as a cathedral or temple. The people who follow
    Jesus are the Church (literally, the Bible translates ἐκκλησίαν which
    means congregation or assembly as church see [Matthew 16](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/matthew/16.htm):18)
- Catholics have the Mass as the central part of their worship, so the table (altar) is at the centre. Baptists have the pulpit and the Bible at the centre stage because their focus is the Bible teaching and the preaching. In an Orthodox church the artwork displays God's glory.
- Local church government is a big deal for us. I grew up in youth groups where we learned to
    make decisions together and choose where to spend our time, effort and
    resources. This is the same for each congregation. As a pastor I get
    one vote, just like every other member of our congregation. People with a history of wisdom and good character have influence, but only one
    vote. This makes it easier for younger people to change the direction
    of the church if they care to be involved.
- Worship styles are mostly set by the people who volunteer to lead. It is easy
    for one volunteer to have a huge influence on the style of worship in
    our form of church.
- There is not much organizational hierarchy in a Baptist church. One church I am pastor of has a "leadership team of 7 people, who meet monthly to
    plan directions and events and finances, and look after everything.
    Today a part of my job is to start the process of hiring 3 summer
    students who will basically work with the rest of our volunteers for
    summer ministry. We have no outside "boss or bishop" to help or
    interfere. The other church I serve as pastor has 2 deacons, and a
    number of volunteers to lead all the ministries.
- Working together with other churches (association principle) is another big
    deal. We work on projects with other churches so we can be more
    effective in ministries. I am in a declining rural community where the
    other churches have basically shut down over the last 50 years. We used to have Catholic, Anglican, United, Pentecostal, 7th Day Adventist, and Presbyterian in our area. We are the last church in this community,
    and the nearest churches in any direction are also a small, rural
    struggling Baptist congregation. Last Friday (Good Friday) we had 7
    different churches meet together for a big celebration.
- Pulpit ministry - One goal of Baptists is to make the Bible teaching clear and accurate. I tend to use two different versions of the Bible in the
    pulpit. [NASB](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3&version=NASB) for accuracy, and the [International Children's Bible](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3&version=ICB) for keeping it simple and clear. Baptist churches also tend to do teaching ministries like Sunday School and youth groups.
- Helping ministries - Baptists tend to think helping the poor is a big deal. We do a food pantry with free food to anyone who needs it any time, no
    matter what their circumstance. We also support the local food bank
    which does great work, but might not be as free to help in some bad or
    emergency situations.

I'm sure there are lots more traditions, but time marches on.
