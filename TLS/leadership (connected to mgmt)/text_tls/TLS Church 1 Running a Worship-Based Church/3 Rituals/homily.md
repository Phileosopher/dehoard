
Public speaking rules apply even w/ homily
- no opening anecdotes unless they apply directly
- shorter is better, esp. w/ [info] culture w/ internet

there's really no good requirement for a homily
- sometimes it can go for hours
- other times it can be about 5-10 minutes
- there's no real requirement for it to be the same amount every time
- people may only need to hear 1 thing, and brevity may matter to drive that idea home
- don't speak more than you need: if you have 15 minutes of things to say, take 15 minutes and wrap up early

all the aspects of good [pedagogy] apply to good preaching and teaching
