## Yearly Rituals

MUST:

- address conventional Christian holidays somehow (e.g., Christmas, Easter)
- address culturally relevant holidays somehow (e.g., Memorial Day, Independence Day)

CAN:

- Lent
    - MUST:
        - focus on the suffering of Christ
        - 40 days of traditional abstinence
    - CAN:
        - have a public Lent service
        - abstinence range: token item all the way to complete ascetic fasting
        - MUST: accommodate the people who can't or won't abstain

CAN'T:

- use shame or guilt to provoke fasting
- imply spiritual "betterness" from it

Tend to the church members' needs MORE than merely evangelism/outreach

- In any large group of individuals, people need certain things (money mgmt, divorce recovery, addiction recovery, parenting problems, marital problems, loss of family/grief recovery, loneliness)
- Attend to these needs first and foremost as a priority
    - Make a system for each, if wanted
    - Make sure someone who is intimately familiar with the problem is running it

One simple idea: offering plate is for needs

- Have the congregants TAKE from the offering plate as well as GIVE
- It puts the faith VERY squarely in God's hands, because it trusts that He will deal with thieves
