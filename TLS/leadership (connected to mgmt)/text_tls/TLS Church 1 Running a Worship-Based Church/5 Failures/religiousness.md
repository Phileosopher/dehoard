
the product of a fakeness of religious practices is an individual phoniness, but has a more sinister problem:
- a culture that maintains it ends up setting an informal false standard of true Christian piety
- in all reality, a Christian who prays once a month, but does it straight from the heart, is doing more with their relationship with God than someone who is doing the same and LYING about how much they do it
- but, the liar will receive the praise, and the culture will become more phony
- instead, the weakest should be praised the most for their weak efforts, since they're the ones who have the hardest challenge regarding changing their [habits]

When Christian leadership advocates for people to be more devoted to particular moral crusades (e.g., maritally faithful, politically involved, missionary-investing) and not centrally focusing on imcreasing love for one another, they invariably MUST lead to propagandizing to get that message across (e.g., awful Christian movies, religious jargon), and the central message of the entire church becomes a hollow shell.

Christian leadership who ramble incessantly about spiritualish-sounding things are weakening the Body. Unless a Christian is feeling provoked to better action when they leave their congregation, the Body suffers.
