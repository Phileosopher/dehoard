We have had near-unlimited freedoms as Christians for a few hundred years now in the West. It hasn't gotten us as far into our exploration of a Christian society as some of the USA's Founders would have hoped for if they weren't discovering life after this one firsthand.

To date, the Protestants have replaced the formal political power structure with a pastor/shepherd role and kept the relatively rigid hierarchy inspired from Judaism. This doesn't represent the relative egalitarianism that defined the early Christian Church.

They also never acknowledged that all believers are technically priests of the Lord, probably because of their [PTSD](https://gainedin.site/ptsd/) of what the Catholics did with the concept. This idea has never been amended.

I'm convinced Protestants haven't gone far enough. The system is still far more bloated than the pure simplicity of Christ-centered leadership. We are called to love one another, irrespective of social status, and reputational status inside the Church has turned it into a game of politics. While the Reformation stripped much of the power from the fully-central authority (i.e., Vatican City), they never decentralized the authority inside each church.

Ironically, this isn't _entirely_ a bankrupt system. Even in a church with very few traditions, the public Assembly service is often renamed the "church service", while the Thanksgiving service is an informal fellowship of Christians following that service at a local lunch place or coffee shop. It's missing the Eucharist, but is still loving believers spending spiritually-minded time together, and it's hard to imagine that [God wouldn't be okay with it](https://icould.fail/trend/).

The knee-jerk reaction I've heard countless times, though, is "Well, that's not _my_ church. Ours isâ€¦
- Spirit-filled
- Doing good works in the community
- Has the right theology
- Is practicing social justice

It may, and I'm not saying that it's not, though I expect [in-group bias](https://gainedin.site/groups-member/) over it. I'd be more inclined to believe it if you spoke well of _other_ churches outside your denomination:

- While I find Third-Wave Pentecostalism theologically shallow, they're often capturing the sentiment of Christian love and [narrativizing](https://gainedin.site/stories/) the power of God very well.
- Southern Baptists have very accurate theological foundations, often with very little works to show for it.
- Calvary Chapel has some of the best [evangelism](https://icould.fail/evangelism/) I've ever seen, even if their discipleship is weak.
- Roman Catholics often understand the importance of spiritual [disciplines](https://gainedin.site/habits/) more than many Protestants, even if they're bogged down by unnecessary tradition.
- Eastern Orthodox are more apt than most denominations to understand the interconnectedness of the universe and God, even while many elements of their value systems are bound without [understanding](https://gainedin.site/understanding/) and solely through [tradition](https://gainedin.site/culture/).

I'm simply saying there's something wrong with the organizational structure, which bleeds down into the rest of the Church's culture. When the business world's management hierarchy is becoming more horizontal than the Church's, or the homosexual community has more solidarity than the Church, this is a sign of horrific sickness, since Christians are supposed to lead the way on [how to run society correctly](https://icould.fail/millennium/).

The Catholic church Latinized the Bible, then made the mistake of not translating it as the language changed, meaning that an accessibility-improving measure became a constraint centuries later. Isn't this the same issue with the culture of Protestantism five centuries later?

I'm not saying to abolish all traditions. I've been around churches that completely abolish _all_ ritual or precept after seeing issues in the Church. While they often capture the intimacy and closeness of being part of the family of God, they easily and quickly devolve into more emotionalist and romanticized elements that veer into heresy, such as accepting prophetic visions or other historical documents on the level of Scripture.

I'm simply making an appeal to taking the long-standing traditions more seriously, and adapt them or remove them. In that sense, the Catholics have been doing remarkable work changing, even if I don't agree with _where_ they're going with their ways. Like any other [creation](https://gainedin.site/creations/) or [habit](https://gainedin.site/habits/), every Protestant tradition is a commentary on Catholicism, which is a commentary on either early Christianity or post-exile Judaism, and both are commentaries on pre-exile Judaism.

In this story of the past, we must find where the thread started unraveling. My personal belief is that we've entered a Dark Age of Christianity that started 1700 years ago when Christians gained political power. The most evident portion of this, in my opinion, is that the beauty and variety that comes through the wide spectrum of every nation, tribe, people, and language is funneled into a rigid set of dull, dead social mores, destined to reproduce through a leadership that fears minor unapproved changes.

All I want to see is that variety make its way into the Church, since those are the building blocks that the Holy Spirit will productively build Christianity.

Thus, I propose the following precepts that the Church should probably do to be less wrong, since churches won't get it right until [Jesus comes back](https://icould.fail/jesus-returns/):

1. Get rid of the clergy/laity dichotomy. All Christians are the New Priesthood of Christ, with Him being High Priest of everyone. All you have are different levels of experience/wisdom, which eventually go away as new believers grow.
2. Lower the requirements for laity to serve. If they can do the job, and are morally upright, you don't have to like them. We're called to love the unlovable for _our_ spiritual benefit, and not simply for their emotional/physical advantage.
3. Don't let arguments among believers persist. This is the number one cause for denominations, which is _literally_ anti-Christ in motivation, since [the Lord hates rebellion as much as witchcraft](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1sa.15.23).
4. Bring back a demarcation between "believer" and "outsider" service, based strictly on baptism. You don't need to be formalized about it or keep records, since a "Christian" who lies about whether they were baptized will show their fruits later.
5. Get rid of "membership", which is a bureaucratic system that echoes of Catholicism. Just have that new attender give their testimony that day, have everyone vote on whether they're legit, and be done with it.
6. Have a proper ejection process for heretics and [conflicts](https://adequate.life/conflicts/). [Matthew 18](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/mat.18) has a good one: confront them privately, then drag a few mutual friends along, then bring it in front of a spiritual leader, then treat them as an outsider.
7. Get rid of the architectural associations to the clergy/laity. Jewish synagogues didn't have anything so heavily defined or lavishly decorated.
8. Get off the political bandwagon. If you live in a republic/democratic State, you get one stupid vote unless you administrate something. Go vote, tell people what you voted for or what they should vote for, and shut up about anything that divides the Body on that matter. A society in Christ is motivated with [the zeal of capitalism mixed with the intentions of communism](https://icould.fail/millennium/), so we worship a God with an unprecedented, absolutely alien polity that won't emerge until [He does](https://icould.fail/jesus-returns/).

## The Pre-Internet Relic

[Technology](https://gainedin.site/technology/) always changes society, often in profound ways. It brings us closer together, helps us move more stuff faster, makes us more [productive](https://adequate.life/success-4/), and makes life overall easier and more [fun](https://adequate.life/fun/).

But, we often can see the downsides of technology as we get older. Every parent can see what mobile devices do to their children, and our parents saw what television did, and radio the generation before that, and cheap books before _that_. Going all the way back, some of the ancient Greek philosophers of yore bemoaned literacy because it stifled our ability to [remember](https://adequate.life/memory/).

However, the younger people aren't so disposed to that resistance. They _always_ get involved in the new [fashions of the day](https://gainedin.site/trends/).

Because of this, you have two major classes of society that has always played out:

1. An aging population who is resisting all the changes going on.
2. A young population who is advancing the trends as fast as they can.

Naturally, teenagers don't have much power. But, in a decade they're old enough and have built enough [social capital](https://gainedin.site/influence/) to propose [new ways of doing things](https://gainedin.site/creativity/). In two decades they start becoming the new [leadership](https://gainedin.site/groups-small/). Within 3-4 decades _they're_ the "old people", and the formerly old people have found certainty about the afterlife, with their wealth of experience and wisdom either getting transferred as tribal knowledge, encoded in language, or being lost to time.

Social changes happen at the speed of information. We're in the [Over-Information Age](https://stucky.tech/purpose/) now, so information travels at the speed of electricity and radio waves, with the only slowdown to rapid information transfer coming strictly from human perceptual capacity.

But, all this information is still largely void of the [meaning](https://gainedin.site/meaning/) that comes from our spirits not having a direct connection with the [One True God](https://icould.fail/god/) or with [others who share that connection](https://icould.fail/church/).

I'm convinced that most of this "empty information" comes from the Church not stepping into this generation's technology. There are several rational reasons why the culture hasn't jived:

1. Church leadership in [the West](https://icould.fail/the-west/) often maintains a far more rigid hierarchical social structure than many other Western cultures. While most companies' "managers" are simply checking in on their charges, many [discipleship-based](https://icould.fail/discipleship/) Bible studies can become extremely involved and, thus, stay relatively inaccessible.
2. There are many heresies, with many silly remixes to the [simple Gospel message](https://icould.fail/gospel/). [The devil](https://icould.fail/demon-tricks/) plays with our fight against wrong thought, and we often veer too far in the opposite direction.
3. It's completely legal to be a Christian (even if its [political stance](https://icould.fail/wokism/) is up for debate), so there's no outside pressure borne of necessity to [change](https://gainedin.site/changes/).
4. [Intellectual properties](https://notageni.us/ip/) are often hyper-managed under archaic and borderline oppressive copyright law, even though there are many worlds of possibility under Creative Commons (and that's not even addressing the worlds of possibility [specific to _computer software_](https://techsplained.xyz/floss/))
5. Given all this, the social system propagates itself with much of the same. While the Body is _absurdly_ diverse (pulling from every tribe, nation, people, and tongue, if we believe [Revelation 7:9-10](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/rev.7)), most of the ideas that could radically allow Christians to love one another by using technology are generally met with unease.

This isn't a bashing of Christian churches, but more a blunt observation of a broad problem, and I mean it to highlight an issue I've devoted my ministry toward.

## The Issue

We need to provoke Christians to adopt today's technology.

For thousands of years, information transfer (and society in general) moved at a leisurely pace of 1-2 events/day. This is no longer true.

Now, if something happens in the MidEast on Monday, everyone's heard about it by Tuesday, and it becomes old news by Thursday, with a new event happening Friday. It means that the weekly Sunday church service is woefully outdated if it was targeting what happened at the beginning of the week, and making a twice-a-week service is barely keeping up.

If you go to any church website, they have the exact same framework:

- Information about where the church is located.
- Doctrinal statement about stuff that church believes.
- Local events happening at the church or, sometimes, in the community that the church is involved in.
- Archives of past sermons.

The [marketing](https://gainedin.site/marketing/) "call to action" is _always_ "go to our church", "go to our church event", or "privately contact a minister". This constrains that church to strictly geographical limits and invalidates the thousands of people who _could_ be positively influenced by the laity.

So, how do we fix this reality? I've been to "organic churches" that meet and mingle in places like bars and coffee shops, but with a central website and seasonal large-scale meeting together. While this isn't bad, it's a heavy cultural shift, and I don't believe we need to reinvent the wheel.

## The Solution

I propose a synthesis of old and new, in the same way that great architecture combines natural and synthetic, or how the arts draw together the past and imaginations of the future.

The entire purpose of the Church, according to the Bible, is God pulling together a network of believers, worshiping together. But, as long as we make the entire experience require being in-person, the Body is geographically constrained. Information travels faster than we can physically go and, as a formerly suicidal ASD, that information can literally save and transform lives by itself.

If you look at the conventional weekly-go-here-and-attend church setup, it's a combination of about the same elements:

1. Networking during the pre-church mingling and afterward: catching up on the week, making plans, praying for each other, even some discipleship and encouragement.
2. Publicly shared singing worship music to the Lord together, often made as a "sandwich" between the rest of the experiences.
3. (optional) Announcements of the other events going on throughout the week.
4. (optional) Honoring of at least _some_ of the sacraments, though mileage varies by denomination.
5. A reading of the Bible and/or [public speech](https://adequate.life/speaking/) from the pastor.
6. (optional) An altar call or "come to Jesus" moment with [the Gospel message](https://icould.fail/gospel/).

Now, let's parse the above and see how we can adapt technology to it:

1. Why does networking _have_ to be in-person? We can make a social media for people to create classified ads, dialogues on web forums, and video chats. Why do people have to go to TikTok or Reddit to find that?
2. Sharing in worship music with the Lord _can_ be powerful, so why not let the shut-ins and geographically distant to share with it in real-time?
3. Everything they're announcing can go online. Why does anyone have to show up at the church to get something that can be online?
4. We certainly don't want to dismiss the importance of breaking bread together. However, it doesn't have to necessarily be done strictly inside the church building as opposed to inside homes.
5. To put bluntly, not all pastors are equally inspired by God for every one of their sermons, and with the _vast_ array of well-read believers in nearly _every_ denomination (along with a vast variety of _highly_ capable laity), there's really no reason for a pastor to get near-burnout providing a weekly message, and the internet makes the pool of potential teachers for a good lesson near-endless.
6. Why are we limiting the Gospel message to simply the end of an emotionally charged message? Why can't it be online?

So, I propose a more online-enabled experience, and believe it must be built soon:

1. Have a church social network of their own, free from [outside influences](https://icould.fail/wokism/). Host it themselves (or with Christians they trust), and network it with other trustworthy churches that exist elsewhere on the planet.
2. Add interaction to online worship, through that social network. This may mean the chat-while-video-playing style you see on YouTube. But, again, to keep it safe from [persecution](https://icould.fail/persecution/), give exclusive technological control to the church leadership.
3. Make announcements public. If the leadership is concerned about who can see it, require that people must be logged in with an approved account to view/comment/whatever.
4. Use that social network to advertise sacraments. Why not have an asynchronous Eucharist, for those who work at that time, or a baptism that's on _very_ public record, or remove the distance factor for those who can't make it to mass?
5. Accumulate and share leaders that legitimately teach the Word, according to what the leadership believe to be right. Put them on social media, or make hyperlinks to them, whatever is correct for the situation.
6. Deliver the Gospel message _everywhere_ through our public online demonstration of our love for each other.

We need a decentralized social Church network to adapt with the times. Instead of redesigning a whole new way of doing church, I propose that we simply meet people where they're at. Let's simply add a technological element to the Church's existing experience that's interactive, safe, reliable, and easy to manage.
