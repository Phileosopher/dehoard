heresy isn't mentioned much, if at all, in the Bible
- there are things that should cast people out, sure
- there's plenty in the Bible about false prophets as well
- however, nothing in the Bible indicates heresy overtly

heresy is referring to practices and behavior against established ecumenical standards/protocol
- however, to be loving in Christ, it may actually be the BEST thing to be a heretic sometimes
- in effect, following Jesus means devotion to Him, and that may mean rejection by everyone around you in some instances

heresy, as a practice, is a political bludgeoning device
- by enforcing the mindset of some things and people being utterly [taboo] at all times, there's room for everyone to rally together against the scapegoat for the purpose of "strengthening the Body"
- in practice, this is a highly unloving behavior to the person receiving it, and should only be performed in response to false doctrine and in the hopes that they repent from their false beliefs

technically, Jesus was a Jewish heretic, and that's how Christianity came into existence
