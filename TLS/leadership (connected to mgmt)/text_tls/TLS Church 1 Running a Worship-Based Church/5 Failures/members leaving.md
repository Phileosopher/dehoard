
There's one question that most Christians would hate to ask the people who stopped going to church, but if they ask they'd be very uncomfortable:
- If church culture something more legitimately like the ACTUAL way the Bible seems to imply people should live, would your religious paths be different?
- A lot of Christian culture exonerates themselves from responsibility for being Christ-like

when a group mandates that people attend things or they're not "real members", they're performing cult-like activities

In non-persecuted Churches, Christianity creates a few lame stereotypes:
- Music, especially the contemporary genre, vaguely referring to either romantic partners or Jesus and surrounded by consumerism.
- Lame, preachy, poorly shot movies that give sermon illustrations more than stories.
- Clothing [brands](https://gainedin.site/symbols/) that identify a Christian long before they can prove it.
- Church [figures of speech](https://gainedin.site/language/) and sayings that are either unbiblical or theologically confusing to non-believers.
- Using "Christian" to [market](https://gainedin.site/marketing/) a product.
- Weekly observance of a church ritual that doesn't translate to daily life.
- cliche jargon[quotes] that doesn't add any meaning

There are 2 mistakenly applied verses in the Bible:
- do not forsake the fellowship of the siblings
- spur one another to good works
- basically, they assume that promoting the HECK out of their events is doing that
- but, that's more accurately "good events" than "good works"
- and, because of the nature of [social groups](https://icould.fail/groups-small), you never see corporate "fellowship" beyond the size of ~15-20 (though you DO see little one-off aside "fellowship" all over)

(for myself) The simple version, to allay concern, is that on the Big 5 I'm not high-enough Agreeableness to get along with others, too high Openness to Experience to enjoy ritual, and too low Extraversion to enjoy the public assembly
