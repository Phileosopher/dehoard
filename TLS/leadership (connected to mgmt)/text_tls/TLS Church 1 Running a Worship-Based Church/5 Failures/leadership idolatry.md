- The product of this is that pastors are required to do what the rest of the world does with [large groups]: be boring and non-dynamic to appeal to the wide range of [personalities] present in the Body
    - The [fashions] shift, though, so the latest trend is to [appear] dynamic even when God made you with the dynamism of an [accountant]

Give away responsibilities whenever possible
- have ppl read Scripture
- give q&a session after the lecture/homily

Christian leaders have a bad habit of making their writing their "tentmaking".
- However, this is a very bad idea because of the nature of writing. Either the ideas are valuable, and they're putting a paywall against the poorest people who would most likely need that information, or they're saying things that have little spiritual value and they'd probably do better for their reputation getting paid in a marketable trade.
