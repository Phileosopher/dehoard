
Most Christian culture REALLY doesn't like to [integrate their shadow].
- It's easier to repress than work with it.
- God designed our personalities AS THEY ARE, and we must know the time and place for them.
- However, most Christian leadership becomes its own [cultural group], with its rules and standards being over-ordered from the intentionally vague components God placed down for EVERYONE to follow
- It can't be fixed completely, since any long-term efforts to do it "right" will be faced by [power games] and corruption, and any [legacy] will be shot down by the spongy-headed babies who eventually grow up to replace them

In societies without [persecution](https://theologos.site/persecution/), the [leadership](https://theologos.site/leadership/) will often become complacent, and persecution has a tendency to rapidly cycle leadership as they're incarcerated or killed.
- For that reason, persecuted churches don't risk the leaders' personality interfering with God's work as much.
- Spiritually young Christians who worship their pastor take away from the worship experience.
