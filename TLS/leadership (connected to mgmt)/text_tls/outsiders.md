I can relate, have been called backslidden, heretic, etc

to be clear on scope, NONE of this is salvific

he defines church differently:
Church - ecclesia
    the people in the Body
church - institution
    the structured organization

to quote someone saying the church institution has suppressed God's people is ironic, since his presence 

1 there are no boxes, there is only a Body
    he says they create pride and divisions
    religion defined by performance, control, and fear (aka "you must")
    it's really about God's perfect performance, and then we freely receive
    we are entering into His rest
    john 6:28-29 - Then they inquired, “What must we do to perform the works of God?” Jesus replied, “The work of God is this: to believe in the One He has sent.”
    the religious mindset is about constant work, but the Kingdom mindset is about letting God have control and Him being the author and finisher of our faith
2 you discern and hear His voice more than you give credit for
    he says it's boxes and fear that makes us doubt and question it
    my sheep hear my voice (John 10:27-28)
    this has generated tons of fear and hesitation
    too many Christians have more faith in the devil deceiving us than in God telling us truths
    MY TAKE: it's not about fear over trusting, ####
    the birds are intuitively doing what they're wired to do, they don't need instruction, and that's how we should be
    he says that religion has perverted it and made us afraid of it
3 he says that "mess" is a product of growing and that religion is intentionally ordered, which obstructs the ability for someone to grow, and we must be okay with the mess

MY RESPONSE
This is a good start for discussion, though I feel he could do well to make another video that cleans up the ideas a bit.
I'll risk writing a mini-dissertation here, so apologies in advance.
To start with, I can entirely relate to the mechanism of being cast out. I've been branded a heretic, and have had a few times the church has outright rejected me.
To build a steel man, he basically asserts the three following ideas:
1. there are no boxes (which is the church), there is only a Body (which is the Church)
2. believers discern and hear His voice more than they give God credit for
3. creating a mess is a natural part of spiritual growth, and the church can suppress that
There's a certain irony he makes in quoting someone: the message of the church suppressing people only came through the institutional mechanism that allowed that individual to say that.

I'm convinced his "box" thinking about how the church works is a bit misguided:
1. If Scripture is any indication, we were originally designed to be directly guided by a literal "benevolent dictator".
2. God is clearly not physically present, so we create order in that absence.
3. It's only a natural product of order-making that we can divide things that ought not be divided.
4. Individual church members will often make idols over those divisions, which can obstruct the simple truths the entire system was originally designed to support.
Recently, I got into a weird argument with someone over their belief that Catholics who don't believe "sole fide" are somehow not going to heaven, which is silly because saying "Christ's sacrifice is sufficient for salvation to those who believe" automatically means "one who believes in Christ's sacrifice as sufficient, along with other stuff they do, receives salvation". The entire thing was splitting hairs.
To reframe it to be more clear, these "boxes" he addresses are simply manifestations of organizational design in the absence of God's presence. It's more a baseline quality of organized people than anything particularly malicious or unusual.
The fact that conscientiousness is a higher representation of personality within church leadership simply magnifies this reality. Some people, believe it or not, ACTUALLY ENJOY working very hard. I can personally relate: God has forced me to do absolutely nothing for this current season, and I'm losing my mind. If the hard-working people like working hard, then that's great, and we only get into a Mary/Martha situation when they start pressuring everyone else.

The second, regarding God's voice, is true, but I think he misplaces the basis. He presumes we're fearful, but I can testify from personal experience that that is *not* the motivating factor. Sometimes, it's a matter of convention.
Up until my recent divorce from Stoic thinking, I had a philosophical stance that the "logos" of the universe existed, then God was a conduit through that logos. This means that God's word wouldn't be that active.
My new perspective is that the very metaphysical design of the universe has always been strictly for the relationship between God and mankind, which means the universe itself is BRIMMING with God's messages and meaning.
It wasn't a cessation of fear, but a philosophical shift that broke my old value system.
Now, granted, a church institution can magnify fears over this sort of thing, but I think he's missing the basis: it's an inward philosophical problem far more than any organizational pedagogy.

As far as the mess, he's correct that it's a product of growing, but he misses that it all should come through what I broadly call "risk tolerance".
Unlike children with toys, making moral missteps can have *very* dangerous consequences. God is faithful to protect us from the worst, but that doesn't mean we ourselves are always comfortable to make risks.
To that end, each believer must work out their own salvation with fear and trembling. This means that some people will be happy to publicly speak tongues according to a spirit (at the risk of it being an unclean spirit), and others may not want to speak at all (to avoid the risk of spreading false doctrine).
If that person is faithful to God in that decision, He will guide them and bless their actions.
