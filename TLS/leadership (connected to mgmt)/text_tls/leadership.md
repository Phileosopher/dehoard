
Ezekiel 33 applies to pastors

when starting, every church has 3 possible pathways they must take:
- renewal - revive what was known-good
- reform - rebuild into a [new trend]
- restitution - bring back things that were lost

the Church falls into the same problem as A/B testing in [marketing] represented in Goodhart's Law
- the actual finish line should be people entering eternity
- however, we can't really KNOW this
- instead, we can measure the conversions, or donations, or number of actively involved members

to explore ecclesiology is to self-reflect on a group's [identity]

it's important to be VERY obsessive about language
- without specificity, people can fall away and the devil can deceive them
- the product of low-language Christianity is to generate moralistic therapeutic deism
