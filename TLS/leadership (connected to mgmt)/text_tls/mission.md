mission is the basis for EVERYTHING in Christianity
- the "missionary" idea is a bit misleading, since it implies ONLY evangelism
- mission incorporates [discipleship], [worship], and [community], since it centralizes on [God's purposes]
- being "missional" can be misunderstood as "evangelistic", which can degenerate into constant [sales] about Jesus
- being "missional" can be misunderstood as "social works", which can often get so engaged in doing things that it misses the gospel of Jesus Christ
- being "missional" can become "macro-missional" or "micro-missional"
