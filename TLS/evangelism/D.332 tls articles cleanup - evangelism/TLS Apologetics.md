[In Judges, though, the tale of Jephthah, who led the Israelites against the Ammonoites, is being told. Being fearful of defeat, this good religious man sought to guarantee victory by getting god firmly on his side.

Frequent Q&A:

Why would God allow the world/me to suffer?

- We are reaping the consequences of our sin condition that came from the Fall (Genesis 3).
- God has permitted suffering to bring godliness, though we don't know why in this life ([1 Timothy 3:16](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/1ti.3.16)).

If God is all-loving but also knows what we'll do, why do people go to hell?

- An all-loving God gives a choice and freedom to choose against the right decision.

If you need to accept Jesus, what happens to babies that die?

- Jesus said the kingdom of heaven goes to children ([Matthew 19:14](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/mat.19.14)).
- On the principle that [God](https://icould.fail/god/) is [just and fair](https://gainedin.site/justice/), He won't judge them the same way as us.

The Bible promotes slavery/incest/rape/polygamy/etc, why would God permit that?

- Our sin condition had taken root by the time He gave the Law.
- The Law made a better life for slaves/women/rape victims/etc. by giving them previously unseen [rights and liberties](https://gainedin.site/boundaries/).
- Jesus was one of the greatest advocates of minorities and women ([John 4](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/jhn.4)).

Most apologetics studies should be a sincere attempt to intimately understand the truth more thoroughly.

NOTE: PULL FROM THE BEGINNING OF GOSPEL SPLICE

Educated non-believers may point out any of [these supposed Bible contradictions](http://www.skepticsannotatedbible.com/).

- Most of them are trying to defend a view instead of learning the truth.
- 90% of the "contradictions" have an easy explanation:
    1. A this/that explanation for something that is both/and (though it may require some thought to find it).
    2. Cultural norms of the time which are foreign to the reader.
    3. Differing eyewitness accounts, which prove the apostles didn't collude.
