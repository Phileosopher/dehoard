GOOD WORKS
from Hebrews 10:19-25
stir one another up to good works
Comfort - giving consolation to others
Commiserate - share in the challenges of daily life
Celebrate - achievements, milestones
Confrontation - when we are wrong
Challenge - iron sharpening iron
Counsel - receiving wise counsel

SINS
usury (lending money and collecting interest) was once considered evil
- basically lending $10 of money should return $10
- the reasoning is that lending $10 and getting $15 is only done through someone in a position of power
- this is no longer [fashionable] now that our [economic] theories accommodate the "time value of money" (i.e., $5 today is more [useful](purpose) to us today than $50 in 10 years)
- more accurately, usury is selling something twice (which is effectively fractional reserve banking)

WORSHIP
worship comes from "worth-ship", to give someone their worthiness
- following Jesus is to give reverence
- Protestants aim for the highest quality of worship (give Him the best of what you have) (Melchizedek story)
- Catholics aim for the highest reverence (give Him the highest sacrifice) (hebrews 13:15-16)
- the focus of the Protestants is the service, while the focus of the Catholics is the Eucharist
historically, this has been a [trend] of its own:
1. there was a Eucharist at the end
2. later, it became an altar call, with Eucharist not mattering as much
3. later later, the homily was the last thing, so that was its epicenter

(make a clear indication of the full Catholic traditions)
(also indicate EO full tradition list)
- then, indicate how things are removed
- also indicate when things get moved around

DENOMINATION DOESN'T MATTER TOO MUCH
- all denominations will burn, with the rest of the world
- what matters is being part of a community with other believers

Ideas to stay faithful (from Ed Newton):
- Word & Worship: Start every day anchored in Scripture and in the presence of God. Let His Word and your worship shape your mindset.
- Filled with the Holy Spirit: Pray and ask the Holy Spirit to lead, guide, and fill you for whatever is ahead.
- Stay Battle Ready: Put on the armor of God. Be aware that challenges will come, but you are equipped to stand firm.
- You Are Enough: Remind yourself of your identity in Christ. You are chosen, called, and fully loved.
- Speak with Confidence: Watch your words. Speak life over yourself and others, aligning your language with Godâ€™s truth.
- God Dream: Keep your God-sized vision in focus. What is He calling you to build or pursue that is bigger than you?
- Availability, Not Ability: Remember that God is not looking for perfection. He is looking for a willing heart. Stay open to what He wants to do through you.
