you should definitely be giving more than 10%
- however, NOT out of shame, but out of gratitude
- as a believer, you owe EVERYTHING to Him
- if we really wanted to be accounting, we should give a portion for the blessings we have:
  - our health
  - our family
  - the Body of Christ supporting us
  - our possessions (both replaceable and irreplaceable)
  - our reputation
  - what God has promised to do
  - the eternal rewards waiting for us
