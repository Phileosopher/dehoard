Language is how we frame the world around us into a type of order. Most people don't consider the implications of this fact.

By using language, we apply a type of logic to what we experience.

The design of logic is an inherently dividing force (i.e., "A, therefore B" automatically describes that there must be something that's not B).

Since we're borrowing words from our prior understanding, we often don't consider the emotional implications of that language, nor whether it was divided in the right place.

Since our choice of words defines so much in our minds, we must be careful to rightly handle any words that lead to action (2 Timothy 2:15).

At the same time, it's always a possibility that some of our conflicts can become utterly petty, and the Bible warns against that (2 Timothy 2:14).

In fact, most denominational schisms have arisen from incredibly small arguments that don't define much about how we should behave.
