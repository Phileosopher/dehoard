this is HUGE:
it's either:
- sola scriptura + ecclesia + holy tradition
- sola scriptura

modern Catholic ideas are [woke], which is a violation of Catholic precedent

Catholics give the idea that they give inspiration that runs alongside Scripture, but there is NOTHING that's universally definitive
- there are no commentaries given as "definitive" about Scripture


there was no canon given to the early Catholic Church, which would have been REALLY helpful against the Gnostics

apostolic succession
2 tim 2:2 - And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others.
- in other words, it's not a secret specialized ordination as much as a public transmission of authority


one mistake:
sola scriptura is saying that the Scripture is all God wanted to have to say
- this does NOT mean there's not more information
  - there's plenty of Biblical scholarship
  - there's tons of historical context and documentation
  - this is all good, and absolutely works great AS SUBORDINATE to Scripture

the Catholic view is that the abstraction stays the same, but the implementation moves around
- they then assert that they're responsible for the authority of deciding and delivering the implementation
