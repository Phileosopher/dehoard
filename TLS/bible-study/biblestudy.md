do NOT start with the question on any passage, "what does this mean to me?"
- instead, that's the LAST question you ask

ways to approach God's word:
1 synchronic (bullet points)
    - making categories of the domains of the Bible (e.g., God, sin, atonement, faith, etc.)
    - focuses on the means (i.e., justification by faith)
2 diachronic (story-based)
    - moving the Bible across its conveyed message (e.g., creation, fall, redemption, renewal)
    - focuses on the trajectory (i.e., Kingdom of God)
- by looking at it synchronically, we develop a zoomed-in view of what God wants us to see
- diachronic indicates [patterns](symbols) that represent along our entire existence
- healthy understanding of Scripture requires dialectically holding BOTH of them together at the same time (story + bullet points)

when Jesus says "I thank you for hiding the secrets from the wise and giving it to the children"
- it is because He wishes to confide the truths to those who are contrite in spirit, lowly, etc.
- those secrets are MEANT to be hidden to those who wish to exploit it or follow many gods at once
