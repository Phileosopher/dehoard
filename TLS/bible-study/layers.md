I like to think of it like "layers".

- Layer 1 - skimming the Bible, where you get the gist of the story as a broad concept (or hear about it from someone in that way)
- Layer 2 - reading the proper story (what you're talking about)
- Layer 3 - interconnecting it with other verses and historical context (which commentary is great for)
- Layer 4 - meditating so deeply on it that God gives further connections through prolonged study

All the layers give inspiration, because God is very clever.
