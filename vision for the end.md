## ST

It will not have much changed, but I may move things around

Consider getting rid of or simplifying the omnibus terms and conditions

Change or remove Buy Me A Coffee

## AL

one page: TL;DR
- at bottom, links to all the notes

## GIS

strip out each essay of the assertions of obvious things
- keep the Application, at least the things that have practical value
- make links to notes about the rest

## TLS

keep the Gospel
- pare down the notes

keep the opinions

get rid of the non-opinions

## NAG

almost everything here goes to notes

keep the opinions
- technical idiot
- modern requirements (rework, though)

## TT

all technical specs and facts moved to notes

keep the opinions
- not understanding is good
- understand primitives

strip out FAANG and send to notes, but keep the ideas
