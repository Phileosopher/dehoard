A great alternative to K Lite Codec Pack for adding thumbnails to file explorer. Icaros is a collection of lightweight, high quality, Windows Shell Extensions, which is capable of providing Windows Explorer thumbnails for essentially any video media filetype. Icaros can provide Windows Explorer thumbnails, for essentially any video media format supported by FFmpeg which includes popular filetypes such as: Mkv, Flv, Avi, Mp4, Mov, Rmvb, M2ts, Ogm etc. It is capable of thumbnailing just about any file by adding its extension(s) to the optional filetypes box and re-activating Icaros.
