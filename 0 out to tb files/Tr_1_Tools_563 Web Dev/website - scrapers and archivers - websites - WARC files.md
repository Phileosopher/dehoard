Convert HTTP Archive (HAR) -> Web Archive (WARC) format

[GitHub - chfoo/warcat: Tool and library for handling Web ARChive (WARC) files.](https://github.com/chfoo/warcat)
My favorite (because it's the easiest) tool for working with Warc files. It allows you to see the list of files in the archive (command "list") and unpack it (command "extract").

[GitHub - datacoon/metawarc: metawarc: a command-line tool for metadata extraction from files from WARC (Web ARChive)](https://github.com/datacoon/metawarc)
Allows you to quickly analyze the structure of the warc file and collect metadata from all the files in the archive
