[Registro Imprese](http://www.registroimprese.it/)
The official Italian companies registry and offers a wide array of basic information and data: company's purpose, legal email address, locations (legal HQ and operative offices or warehouses, etc). A few times it reports the date of establishment or when a company started providing a specific service/activity. It is only in Italian but has a very easy interface. The basic searching service is free, but it is possible to buy reports and specific information about a company. Same old story as for any other national registry.

[Info Imprese](http://infoimprese.it/)

It is perfect to validate the results you may have previously found on registroimprese.it.
