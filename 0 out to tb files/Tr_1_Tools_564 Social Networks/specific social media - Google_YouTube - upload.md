[YouTube Face Blur](http://youtube-global.blogspot.nl/2012/07/face-blurring-when-footage-requires.html)
Developed out of concern for the anonymity of individuals who appear in videos in high-risk situations, this tool allows users to blur faces of people who appear in videos they upload. To use, when you upload a video on YouTube, go to Enhancements, and then Special Effects. There you can choose to blur all faces in the video.
