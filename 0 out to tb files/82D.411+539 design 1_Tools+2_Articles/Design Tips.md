Designing a balanced, consistent logo garden: search "[name] logo svg". Put them all in the same artboard and optically adjust each logo within the artboard so they feel balanced. I usually start by setting a max width for horizontal icons and max height for square/more vertical ones, then adjust if needed. Export artboards as SVGs.
