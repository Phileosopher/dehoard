C - Contrast
Everything should be visible.
If you're a designer, you have probably heard about a new standard - ACPA.
Not yet officially adopted, but it seems like it's going to be used in WCAG 3.

R - Repetition
Use the same style, fonts, colors, elements, design system. Standardize.
Make systems. Follow them.
P.S. It doesn't mean to use only one button, I hope you got the idea.

A - Alignment.
Aligning elements in a design makes everything organized.
Easy to follow.
Super important principle.

P - Proximity.
In my opinion the most important rule.
Grouping related items together creates a clear visual structure.
Group what is related together. And give enough space between those groups.

Seems obvious?
81% of home pages have text with low contrast, which does not meet the WCAG 2 AA thresholds.
Alignment and proximity - violated all the times.
The repetition rule is less frequently violated compared to other design principles, in my opinion.
