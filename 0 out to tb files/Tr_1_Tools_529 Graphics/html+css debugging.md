[debugCSS](https://imbrianj.github.io/debugCSS/)
(X)HTML debugging tool built with CSS
debugCSS is meant to be loaded on an existing page to highlight potentially broken, malformed or legacy (X)HTML. Not all "errors" are created equally, so they are color coded to highlight severity. Green is "probably not a big problem", yellow is "worth looking at" and red is "you really should fix this."

[Revenge.css](http://heydonworks.com/revenge_css_bookmarklet/)
is a CSS bookmarklet that reports bad html using pseudo content. If the page you use it with has malformed links, deprecated attributes, <div>s inside inline elements, inaccessible buttons, badly nested sections or other errors, you'll see some ugly, pink errors written in nobody's favourite font: Comic Sans.
