(2009) Why programmers are not paid in proportion to their productivity
> 1. extreme productivity may not be obvious
> 2. programmers are most effective when they avoid writing code
> 3. when they are being their most productive, nobody says “Wow! You were just 100x more productive than if you’d done this the hard way. You deserve a raise.”
> 4. it may take a long time to realize that others are programming with sound and fury but producing nothing.
