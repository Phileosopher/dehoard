
Part of diversification is considering the risk vs. return ratio. Any
area you decide to invest in may be high or low risk and high or low
return on investment. For instance, learning a popular technology such
as .NET is fairly low risk - many legions of programmers are doing it,
so there is plenty of support, published books, courses, job openings,
and so on. But that also means it's fairly low return on investment -
there are many legions of programmers doing it, so there's a lot of
competition for those job openings. The fact that you do it isn't so
special. Today, any number of technologies on the horizon are high risk
and potentially high reward. They may go nowhere - that's the risk.
Erlang or Haskell may be the next major language breakthrough. Or not.

One major difference between knowledge investments and financial
investments is that all knowledge investments have some value.
