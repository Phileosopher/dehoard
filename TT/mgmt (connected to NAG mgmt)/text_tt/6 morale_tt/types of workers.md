There are 3 major classes of programmer, for the sake of doing work:
1. wet behind the ears, just started working as a professional programmer and need lots of guidance
2. sort of knows what they're doing and can mostly finish tasks on their own
3. experienced, who legitimately know how things work and answer other programmers' questions (NOT necessarily based on title, and most programmers never get here EVER)
    NOTE: this is based on curiosity and interest in the subject more than years experienced

- At #2, you can either become a proper manager or stay on to become #3, and lazy people want #2
    You NEED #3 in the trenches, since some solutions can only come from experience and intuition for things
