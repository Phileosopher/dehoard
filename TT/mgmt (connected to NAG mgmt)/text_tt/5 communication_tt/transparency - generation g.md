
What is the internet, then? Libertarian? The internet champions and enables personal liberty.

The internet not as left, right, or libertarian bus as the connection machine that brings together any and all worldviews.

The internet doesn't make us more creative. Instead, it enables what we create to be seen, heard, and used. It enables every creator to find a public.

That takes creation out of the proprietary hands of the supposed creative class. Curmudgeons argue that they rob the creative class of its financial support and exclusivity: its pedestal.

The internet lets us find people who like what we do.

The internet kills the mass: mass economics and mass media.

Curmudgeons argue that it's flooded with crap. Only the playing field is flat. To stand out, one must rise on worth - as is defined by the public, rather than the priests - and the reward is attention.

We want to create and we want to be generous with our creations. We will get the attention we deserve. That means crap will be ignored. It just depends on your definition of crap.
