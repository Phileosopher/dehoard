
Any software system should be able to be guided by an appropriate
metaphor. For instance, a payroll system might be considered analogous
to a post office, with discrete mailboxes, delivery schedules, and so
on. All metaphors break down eventually, but the idea was that a
sufficiently rich metaphor could help guide the design of a system and
help answer questions that come up during development.

Why do we insert something into a container instead of add it?
Programmers are sloppy in their use of metaphors - such as "tables".
