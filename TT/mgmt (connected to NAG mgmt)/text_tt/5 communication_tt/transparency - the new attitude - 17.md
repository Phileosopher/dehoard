
The more you control, the less you will be trusted. The more you hand over control, the more trust you will earn.

The powerful must learn to trust the public.

We still need editors, curators, teachers to find and nurture the best.

Traditionalists suggest we throw out the internet baby with the bathwater. One nasty comment, one hoax, and they try to use that to discredit the entirety of a service as a whole.

Corrections enhance credibility. Standing up and admitting your errors makes you more believable. It gives your audience faith that you will right your future wrongs.

The worst mistake is to act as if you don't make mistakes.

Blog about your plans and decisions. Join in human conversations with customers. Ask people what you should do.

Your competitive advantage is not that your designs are secret, but that you have a strong relationship with your community of customers.

Companies should be meritocracies.

Speed is a strategic necessity. Adjust to customers' actions and desires quickly. Learn from them and stay ahead of them.

Holding back products and popping them out as surprises insults your customers (unless you're Apple). The earlier they're involved with the process, the better.

Beware any strategy built on protection from cannibalization, for it probably means the cannibals are at the door and ready to eat you for lunch.

Cash flow can blind you to the strategic necessity of change, though decisions, and innovation.

Approach innovation in that order: first find the problem, then create the solution. Beware the cool idea.

Design is about more than aesthetics. Design is an ethic. Design is the path by which you interact with your public. Magazines, clothes, and cars aren't the only things that are designed. Companies are designed. Services are designed. Rules are designed.
The simpler and clearer the design, the better. To be simple is to be direct. To be direct is to be honest.

If you make a great platform, the worst thing you could do is to put yourself in the middle, getting in the way of what people want to do with it.

Make something useful. Help people use it. Then get out of the way.
