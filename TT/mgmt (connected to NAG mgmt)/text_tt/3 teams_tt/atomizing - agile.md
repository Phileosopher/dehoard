When software teams worked on longer-term projects, they were
inefficient and took unnecessary paths. However, when job tasks were
broken down into particular problems to be solved, which were manageable
and could be tackled within one or two weeks, developers were more
creative and effective. The practice of smallifying problems.

One of the great benefits of the agile approach is that it is also a
good method for failing fast. If you can launch ten features in the same
time it takes a competitor to launch one, you'll have ten times the
amount of experience to draw from in figuring out what has failed the
test of customer acceptance and what has succeeded.
