When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four different people,
no one of whom really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room.
It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft. The
right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply
defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between
them that are as carefully designed.
