## Bitcoin accounting

For a while, US generally accepted accounting principles treated Bitcoin in kind of a strange way. If a company bought some Bitcoin, it would hold that Bitcoin on its balance sheet at cost, reporting that it was worth what it paid. If the price of Bitcoin went up, the company would not increase the value on its balance sheet, or report any income: GAAP disregarded the mark-to-market move. But if the price went _down_, the company _would_ reduce the value on its balance sheet, and report a loss in its income statement: GAAP did reflect "impairment" of the Bitcoin holdings.

We have [talked](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-08/elon-musk-works-his-magic-on-dogecoin-and-bitcoin) about this [before](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-28/elon-musk-made-tesla-some-money-on-bitcoin), and companies sometimes complained about it, because it was illogical and rather punitive: For accounting purposes, you could lose money on Bitcoin, but [never make money](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-03/money-stuff-your-auditor-is-not-your-friend). There was however another feature of this situation, which is:

1. It can't really _last:_ If Bitcoin is going to become a mainstream holding of big companies, eventually the accounting has to get rationalized. And in fact, last year, the US Financial Accounting Standards Board voted to [approve a new standard](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-09-07/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-don-t-let-robots-do-earnings-calls) requiring fair-value accounting for Bitcoin.
2. When the accounting _is_ rationalized, companies with Bitcoins will probably get big one-time gains, because they will get to mark all their Bitcoins to market all at once.

And so [Bloomberg News reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-06/saylor-s-bitcoin-bet-has-microstrategy-mstr-on-verge-of-accounting-windfall):

> MicroStrategy Inc. may be at an inflection point when it comes to Michael Saylor's controversial decision almost four years ago to bet the enterprise-software maker's future on Bitcoin.
> 
> Quarterly results will likely get more volatile under a recently approved accounting rule change that requires valuing the digital asset at market prices. Before the revision, MicroStrategy had to take impairment charges to write down the value of its Bitcoin when prices fell but couldn't recognize any increases. It has until 2025 to implement the change.
> 
> If Tysons Corner, Virginia-based MicroStrategy decides to adopt the revision for the fourth quarter, the Bitcoin on the company's balance sheet will surge by billions of dollars on the back of recent purchases and Bitcoin's almost 60% rally in the period.

I don't really know what that gets you. If MicroStrategy's shareholders weren't paying attention to the market value of its Bitcoin holdings, what _were_ they paying attention to? My general view is that investors are smart enough to look past GAAP accounting when, as here, GAAP accounting is misleading. But at least now the GAAP accounting will be correct.

## American Bitcoin Academy

Look, I'm sorry, but if you asked me to design an educational course about Bitcoin, it would have the following curriculum:

1. You send me a bunch of Bitcoins.
2. I steal your Bitcoins.
3. Then someone hacks _my_ Bitcoin wallet and steals the Bitcoins from me.
4. You come to me and say "what the heck, man?"
5. I say "now you understand Bitcoin."

This service would be well worth the price you paid me (all your Bitcoins), though I would not get rich off of it (because I would lose all the Bitcoins). Anyway here is a very funny [US Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement action](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-13) against the founder of the American Bitcoin Academy, who did a spectacularly good job of educating his students about Bitcoin:

> The Securities and Exchange Commission [Friday] announced that Brian Sewell and his company, Rockwell Capital Management, agreed to settle fraud charges in connection with a scheme that targeted students taking Sewell's online crypto trading course known as the American Bitcoin Academy. The SEC alleges that the fraudulent scheme cost 15 students $1.2 million. 
> 
> According to the SEC's complaint, from at least early 2018 to mid-2019, Sewell encouraged hundreds of his online students to invest in the Rockwell Fund, a hedge fund that he claimed he would launch, and which would use cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and trading strategies involving crypto assets to generate returns for investors. The complaint alleges that Sewell, who resided in Hurricane, Utah, before relocating to Puerto Rico, received approximately $1.2 million from 15 students but never launched the fund nor executed the trading strategies he advertised to investors, instead holding on to the invested money in bitcoin. The complaint further alleges that the bitcoin was eventually stolen when Sewell's digital wallet was hacked and looted.

A Bitcoin hack was their Yale College and their Harvard.
