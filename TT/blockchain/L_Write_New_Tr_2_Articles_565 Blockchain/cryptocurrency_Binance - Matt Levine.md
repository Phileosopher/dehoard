## Binance

Broadly speaking the US government has two objections to Binance Holdings Ltd.:

1. Binance is a crypto exchange, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission thinks that crypto exchanges are more or less illegal under US law.
2. Binance, as a crypto exchange, provides a way for people to move money internationally, and the US Department of Justice thinks that Binance lets _bad_ people move _bad_ money to and from bad countries.

We have [talked about](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-06-06/the-sec-comes-for-crypto) the first objection before, because the SEC has actually sued Binance and laid out its objections. But it is, I think, _by far_ the less serious objection, for several reasons:

1. The SEC might be wrong on the law? There is very much a live controversy about whether US securities regulation applies to crypto as broadly as the SEC thinks it does, and other crypto firms have fought the SEC in court and [sometimes even won](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-07-14/ripple-is-a-security-and-it-isn-t). Whereas if the Justice Department is like "you laundered money for criminals and violated US sanctions," look, they _might_ be wrong, but you are going to have a much harder time fighting that in court.
2. Even if the SEC is right, there is a fairly simple solution: Stop letting US customers trade on Binance. It is broadly illegal to do securities stuff with US customers without following SEC rules, but it cannot actually be illegal under US law for a foreign company to allow foreign customers to trade foreign securities. Whereas it _kind of is illegal under US law for a foreign company to allow foreign customers to send money to Iran_. If you operate a crypto exchange with absolutely no US customers at all, but you let terrorist organizations move money on it, the US is going to care. You can ring-fence yourself from the US and solve your securities-law problems, but that doesn't work for your money-laundering or sanctions problems.
3. The SEC can't put you in jail, but the Justice Department can.

Now, I don't know exactly what the Justice Department's concerns with Binance are, because I have not yet seen its complaint. But just as a structural matter you can tell that (1) they're serious and (2) Binance is taking them seriously. So Bloomberg's Chris Strohm, Allyson Versprille and Olga Kharif [reported yesterday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-20/us-seeks-more-than-4-billion-from-binance-to-end-criminal-case):

> The US Justice Department is seeking more than $4 billion from Binance Holdings Ltd. as part of a proposed resolution of a years-long investigation into the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.
>
> Negotiations between the Justice Department and Binance include the possibility that its founder Changpeng Zhao would face criminal charges in the US under an agreement to resolve the probe into alleged money laundering, bank fraud and sanctions violations, according to people familiar with the discussions.
>
> Zhao, also known as "CZ," is residing in the United Arab Emirates, which doesn't have an extradition treaty with the US, but that doesn't prevent him from coming voluntarily. …
>
> With respect to possible sanctions violations, the Justice Department has been investigating Binance for allegedly aiding in the evasion of US sanctions against Iran and Russia, one of the people said. Binance has also been under scrutiny for whether it allowed transactions that helped finance Hamas.

I don't give legal advice around here but my general view is that if you are a foreigner living abroad and the US government is like "why don't you voluntarily come over here so we can put you in prison for money laundering" you should maybe _not_ volunteer for that? But what do I know; the Wall Street Journal [just reported](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-step-down-plead-guilty-01f72a40):

> The chief executive of Binance, the largest global cryptocurrency exchange, plans to step down and plead guilty to violating criminal U.S. anti-money-laundering requirements, in a deal that may preserve the company's ability to continue operating, according to people familiar with the matter. 
>
> Changpeng Zhao is scheduled to appear in Seattle federal court Tuesday afternoon and enter his plea, the people said. Binance, which Zhao owns, will also plead guilty to a criminal charge and agree to pay fines totaling $4.3 billion, which includes amounts to settle civil allegations made by regulators, the people said. ...
>
> The deal would allow Zhao to retain his majority ownership of Binance, although he won't be able to have an executive role at the company. He would face sentencing at a later date.

## Binance

Here are two possible theories of what Binance _is:_

1. Binance is the world's leading crypto exchange, a large financial institution that allows investors, speculators, hedgers and other users to transact in the trillion-dollar cryptocurrency sector. It is in many ways the leading financial institution in crypto, but it is fairly young and aggressive, and it has not always been very careful about compliance. In particular, it has not been careful about anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer checks, and so has allowed a certain number of bad people to do bad transactions using crypto.
2. Binance is a place for laundering money.

These theories differ in degree; they start from similar facts but emphasize them differently. Nobody disputes that a lot of criminals have laundered money on Binance. "For example," the US Department of Justice pointed out in a [criminal information](https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rxHkd6CQjOgQ/v0) against Binance last week, "in a February 2019 chat conversation, one compliance employee wrote, 'we need a banner "is washing drug money too hard these days - come to binance we got cake for you."'" If your _compliance employees_ are suggesting that you _advertise your drug money laundering business_, that seems bad.

And yet last week's US federal charges against Binance struck me as fairly gentle. The US Securities and Exchange Commission, in practice though not in so many words, takes the position that _crypto exchanges are fundamentally illegal_; the practical goal of [its crypto enforcement actions (including against Binance)](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-06-06/the-sec-comes-for-crypto) is to shut them down, or at least shut them out of the US. The US Department of Justice does _not_ take that position; its basic theory of Binance is that Binance messed up, a lot, and has to pay a huge fine and change its practices, but that it can go ahead and do that. It's a basically legitimate business with a money laundering problem, the Justice Department thinks. Which is a pretty good outcome?

Anyway here are the Justice Department [press release](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution) from last Tuesday, the [charging document](https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rxHkd6CQjOgQ/v0) and Attorney General [Merrick Garland's remarks](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-announcing-binance-and-ceo-guilty). Binance will pay about $4.3 billion and "retain an independent compliance monitor for three years and remediate and enhance their anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programs." There was a time, not so long ago, when people thought that it was a death blow to a financial institution to make it plead guilty to criminal charges. But [that time ended](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2015-05-11/nobody-s-worried-about-too-big-to-jail-any-more), and now it is … not routine, maybe, but kind of acceptable for a big bank or other financial institution to plead guilty to crimes. Binance is in some sense just a financial institution like any other, and paying $4.3 billion to settle compliance problems is … almost a step toward the mainstreaming of crypto?

Maybe that is too glib. Binance founder Changpeng "CZ" Zhao pleaded guilty to his own federal crimes and agreed to step down as chief executive officer; he faces prison time, which is pretty unusual for the CEO of a financial institution. [Patrick McKenzie argues](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/bond-villain-compliance-strategy/) that this is the beginning of the end for Binance, that it "is going to be slowly ground into a very fine paste." But my impression is that US prosecutors can make varying amounts of hay out of "this company sent money to terrorists," and in this case they are [making an average amount of hay](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/hamas-use-of-binance-cited-in-4-3-billion-settlement-with-us). This reads, to me, like the guilty plea of a troubled financial institution, not the guilty plea of a criminal conspiracy that the government wants to end.

To be clear, though, Binance's compliance [was very bad](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution):

> Binance also did not implement the core components of an effective AML program: Binance did not implement comprehensive know-your-customer (KYC) protocols or systematically monitor transactions, and Binance never filed a suspicious activity report (SAR) with FinCEN. For years, Binance allowed users to open accounts and trade without submitting any identifying information beyond an email address. Binance began requiring all users to provide KYC information in August 2021 but allowed users who had not provided KYC to continue trading on the exchange until May 2022. ...
>
> As Binance's internal communications showed, Binance's compliance employees recognized that Binance did not have protocols to flag or report transactions for money laundering risks, which employees recognized would attract criminals to the exchange. As one compliance employee wrote, "we need a banner 'is washing drug money too hard these days - come to binance we got cake for you.'" Due in part to Binance's failure to implement an effective AML program, illicit actors used Binance's exchange in various ways, including conducting transactions for mixing services that obfuscated the source and ownership of cryptocurrency; transferring illicit proceeds from ransomware variants; and moving proceeds of darknet market transactions, exchange hacks, and various internet-related scams.

One other point. I [wrote last week](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-21/openai-is-a-strange-nonprofit) that a problem, for Binance, is that "you can ring-fence yourself from the US and solve your securities-law problems, but that doesn't work for your money-laundering or sanctions problems": US authorities don't like big financial institutions laundering money for terrorists even if they _don't_ have US customers. I _kind_ of still think that's true, but I must say that last week's charges suggest that just blocking US users is a possible option for Binance. From the [charging document](https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rxHkd6CQjOgQ/v0):

> Defendant understood that the Company would violate U.S. laws by matching U.S. users with users in comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions, but it did not implement sufficiently effective controls to prevent such sanctions violations from occurring. For example, Defendant could have removed from Binance's platform all accounts associated with either (i) U.S. users or (ii) users in comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions. Or Defendant could have implemented controls in its matching engine to prevent U.S. users from violating sanctions by preventing them from transacting with users in comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions.

What an amazing suggestion. The Justice Department is saying that, if Binance (1) had North Korean customers, (2) had US customers, (3) did not allow them to trade directly with each other (by programming its matching engine to reject trades between US and North Korean customers), but (4) allowed third-country market makers to intermediate trades between them, _that would be fine and the US government would not object_. I don't think I believe that but it is an interesting idea.

Elsewhere, the Wall Street Journal reports on "[Sam Bankman-Fried's Life Behind Bars: Crypto Tips and Paying With Fish](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/sam-bankman-frieds-life-behind-bars-crypto-tips-and-paying-with-fish-858097c6)." Back when Bankman-Fried, [Alex Mashinsky](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/business/celsius-cryptocurrency-founder-arrested.html), the [Three Arrows guys](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/29/technology/su-zhu-founder-crypto-three-arrows-capital-arrested.html), [Do Kwon](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/montenegro-court-approves-extradition-cryptocurrency-king-do-kwon-2023-11-24/) and other tarnished crypto luminaries were in their various legal limbos, I liked to imagine them all living in a group house in a non-extradition country, filming a reality television show, grousing about whose manipulative trading destroyed whose project. Now they're all in jail though. But if CZ _does_ get sent to prison in the US I suppose there is still a possibility that he and Bankman-Fried will be roommates?

## Binance is law-abiding now

Crypto is mature enough by now that there are some good running bits, some callbacks to old jokes. Tether has spent years telling anyone who will listen that it is just months away from releasing an audit, and everyone has a good laugh each time. And Binance has spent years [claiming that it was located nowhere](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/bond-villain-compliance-strategy/), to the point that when [Chinese police reportedly raided its Shanghai office](https://www.theblock.co/post/48112/setting-the-record-straight-on-our-binance-reporting), Binance [replied that](https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-denies-police-raids-very-existence-of-shanghai-offices) it "has no fixed offices in Shanghai or China, so it makes no sense that police raided on any offices and shut them down." Classic.

But then Binance [pleaded guilty](hhttps://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution) to a bunch of money laundering charges in US federal court, agreeing to pay $4.3 billion in penalties and install a compliance monitor to be generally more law-abiding. Its founder and chief executive officer, Changpeng "CZ" Zhao, also pleaded guilty and stepped down as CEO. You might think this would put an end to the "no location" bit but, no, it's too good. The [Financial Times reports on the new CEO](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution), Richard Teng:

> Teng on Tuesday declined to reveal where the exchange was based. He also said Binance has undergone audits in jurisdictions where it is regulated, but declined to name the audit firms involved.
>
> "Why do you feel so entitled to those answers?" Teng asked at the FT Crypto and Digital Assets Summit in London, adding that the company provides the necessary information to regulators. "Is there a need for us to share all of this information publicly? No." 

I guess not, no, I guess it's fine for a financial institution trusted with billions of dollars of customer money not to be located in any particular jurisdiction? Binance's [plea agreement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1326901/dl?inline) requires it to hire a monitor to write reports on its anti-money-laundering compliance and share them with the US Department of Justice, and requires Binance to "provide the Monitor with access to all … facilities, and employees, as reasonably requested by the Monitor, that fall within the scope of the Mandate of the Monitor," so I suppose the Justice Department can find out where Binance is located, but maybe not? Maybe the monitor will be like "hey can I visit headquarters" and Binance will say "why do you feel entitled to that"?
