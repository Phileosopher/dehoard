Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against traffic analysis.

:::caution - I'm not responsible for the links, domains, it's content or if the provided `.onion` links are really the ones advertised. It's impossible for me as individual person to check every single page every second and monitor it's content.

Also be very carefull of scams. you can find the links to some scam sites on [`torss7t3bxd3qsxn.onion`](http://torss7t3bxd3qsxn.onion/)

info - If you suspect your access to the Tor network is being blocked, you may want to use bridges.

You can get latest Tor bridges from [bridges.torproject.org](https://bridges.torproject.org/)

tip - Just replace .onion with .onion.ws or any other domain made available by volounteers [Tor2web](https://www.tor2web.org/) operators.

Example: `http://archivecaslytosk.onion/ => http://archivecaslytosk.onion.ws/`

This connects you with Tor2web, which then talks to the onion service via Tor and relays the response back to you.

WARNING: Tor2web only protects publishers, _not readers_. As a reader installing Tor Browser will give you much greater anonymity than using Tor2web. Using Tor2web trades off security for convenience and usability.
