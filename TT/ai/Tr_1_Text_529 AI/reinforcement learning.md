Basic reinforcement learning is a classic machine learning technique inspired by behaviorist psychology, where getting a positive reward increases your tendency to do something again and vice versa.
DeepMind combined this idea with deep learning: they trained a deep neural net to predict how many points would on average be gained by pressing each of the allowed keys on the keyboard, and then the AI selected whatever key the neural net rated as most promising.
That's deep reinforcement learning.

If you're a robot, life itself can be viewed as a game.
All that's needed is a system that gives it points whenever it makes progress.

AlphaGo displayed both intuition and creativity.
Combining the intuition of deep learning with the logic of "good old-fashioned AI" can produce second-to-none strategy.
AlphaGo was to marry the intuitive power of deep learning with the logical power of "good old-fashioned AI".
They used a massive database of Go positions from both human play and games where AlphaGo had played a clone of itself, and trained a deep neural network to predict from each position the probability that white would ultimately win.
They also trained a separate network to predict likely next moves.
They then combined these networks with a "good old-fashioned AI" method that cleverly searched through a pruned list of likely future-move sequences to identify the next move that would lead to the strongest position down the road.

The Winograd Schema Challenge asks what "they" refers to here:
1. "The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence."
2. "The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence."

It's getting progressively harder to argue that AI completely lacks goals, breadth, intuition, creativity or language.

Verification asks "Did I build the system right?"
Validation asks "Did I build the right system?"

Does the system rely on assumptions that might not always be valid?
If so, how can it be improved to better handle uncertainty?
