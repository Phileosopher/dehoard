Digital Athens:
The reason that the Athenian citizens of antiquity had lives of leisure where they could enjoy democracy, art and games was mainly that they had slaves to do much of the work.
But why not replace the slaves with AI-powered robots?

Inequality? The main cause is something else: technology. Digital technology drives inequality.

Game theory elegantly explains that entities have an incentive to cooperate where cooperation is a so-called Nash equilibrium: a situation where any party would be worse off if they altered their strategy.
To prevent cheaters from ruining the successful collaboration of a large group, it may be in everyone's interest to relinquish some power to a higher level in the hierarchy that can punish cheaters.
For example, people may collectively benefit from granting a government power to enforce laws, and cells in your body may collectively benefit from giving a police force (immune system) the power to kill any cell that acts too uncooperatively.
For a hierarchy to remain stable, its Nash equilibrium needs to hold also between entities at different levels: for example, if a government doesn't provide enough benefit to its citizens for obeying it, they may change their strategy and overthrow it.

How is technology changing the hierarchical nature of our world?
History reveals an overall trend toward ever more coordination over ever-larger distances.
Although our present world remains stuck in a multipolar Nash equilibrium, with competing nations and multinational corporations at the top level, technology is now advanced enough that a unipolar world would probably also be a stable Nash equilibrium.

- The opinion on the first comment: in the future AI will enhance because it's cheaper than hardware, and everyone will falsely remember reality and demand more clarity to it than actually exists

It's a mistake to passively ask "what will happen," as if it were somehow predestined!
Instead ask: "What should happen? What future do we want?"
If we don't know what we want, we're unlikely to get it.
Do you want to maximize positive experiences, minimize suffering, or leave this to sort itself out?

To the vastly more intelligent entities that would exist at that time, an uploaded human may seem about as interesting as a simulated mouse or snail would seem to us.
Although we currently have the technical capability to reanimate old spreadsheet programs from the 1980s in a DOS emulator, most of us don't find this interesting enough to actually do it.

Valuing diversity, and recognizing that different people have different preferences, the AI has divided Earth into different sectors for people to choose between, to enjoy the company of kindred spirits.
Here are some examples:
• Knowledge sector: Here the AI provides optimized education, including immersive virtual-reality experiences, enabling you to learn all you're capable of about any topics of your choice. Optionally, you can choose not to be told certain beautiful insights, but to be led close and then have the joy of rediscovering them for yourself.
• Art sector: Here opportunities abound to enjoy, create and share music, art, literature and other forms of creative expression.
• Hedonistic sector: Locals refer to it as the party sector, and it's second to none for those yearning for delectable cuisine, passion, intimacy or just wild fun.
• Pious sector: There are many of these, corresponding to different religions, whose rules are strictly enforced.
• Wildlife sector: Whether you're looking for beautiful beaches, lovely lakes, magnificent mountains or fantastic fjords, here they are.
• Traditional sector: Here you can grow your own food and live off the land as in yesteryear - but without worrying about famine or disease.
• Gaming sector: If you like computer games, the AI has created truly mind-blowing options for you.
• Virtual sector: If you want a vacation from your physical body, the AI will keep it hydrated, fed, exercised and clean while you explore virtual words through neural implants.
• Prison sector: If you break rules, you'll end up here for retraining unless you get the instant death penalty.

The AI enforces two tiers of rules: universal and local.
Universal rules apply in all sectors, for example a ban on harming other people.
Individual sectors have additional local rules on top of this, encoding certain moral values.
The sector system therefore helps deal with values that don't mesh.

Talk of a robot-rights movement is met with chuckles. Why? One common pro-slavery argument is that slaves don't deserve human rights because they or their race/species/kind are somehow inferior. For enslaved animals and machines, this alleged inferiority is often claimed to be due to a lack of soul or consciousness.

We've dramatically underestimated life's future potential.
We're not limited to century-long life spans marred by disease.
Life has the potential to flourish for billions of years, throughout the cosmos.

These ultimate limits are set not by our understanding, but by the laws of physics.
This, ironically, makes it in some ways easier to analyze the long-term future of life than the short-term future.
