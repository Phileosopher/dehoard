
Two very different types of artificial intelligence:
artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) - also known as weak AI
artificial general intelligence (AGI) - also known as strong or full AI
An AGI is an AI system which can carry out any cognitive function that a human can.

We can learn useful lessons from one activity and apply them to another.
A machine that learns snakes and ladders has to forget that in order to learn how to play Ludo.
This is called "catastrophic forgetting".

"Artificial intelligence"?:
Cars are not called artificial horses.
Planes are not called artificial birds.

The three biggest questions about artificial general intelligence (AGI) are:
1. Can we build one?
2. If so, when?
3. Will it be safe?
The first of these questions is the closest to having an answer, and that answer is "probably, as long as we don't go extinct first".

Artificial superintelligence (ASI) is generally known simply as superintelligence. It does not need the prefix "artificial" since there is no natural predecessor.

Neurons signals in our brain travel around 100 metres per second.
Synapse crossing is chemicals jumping across the gap.
Synapse jumping part is much slower than the electrical part.
Signals within computers typically travel at 200 million metres per second.
So a brain emulation AGI could operate 2 million times faster than a human.

When we create superintelligence, will we create one, two, or many?
The first superintelligence may take steps to prevent the creation of a competitor.

Superintelligence with human levels of cognitive ability would be a technological marvel, and a harbinger of things to come.
Superintelligence would be the game-changer.
Our future will depend on its decisions and its actions.

Transhumanists believe we have every right to enhance our physical and mental selves using whatever technology we can create - perhaps even that we have a moral duty to do so.

Humanity versus a fully fledged superintelligence with internet access would be like the Amish versus the US Army.

We can use AI to augment us rather than having to compete with it. This is called Intelligence Augmentation, or IA, and is also known as intelligence amplification.
The best chess players today are neither humans nor computers, but a combination of both - labelled "centaurs" by Gary Kasparov.

Musk believes that humans cannot afford to let machines get much smarter than them, and the only way to avoid that is to - at least partly - merge with them.

Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics:
How far into the future would a robot have to project the consequences of an individual action?
How would it assign probabilities to the various different possible outcomes?
Since there should be no time limit, a robot would be rendered inactive by the amount of calculation required prior to any action.

Humans - as well as the superintelligence - will evolve over time and would not want to be stuck with the particular ideas of morality and pragmatism which happened to prevail in the 21st century.

Few of us even know the names of Vasili Arkhipov and Stanislav Petrov, two men who quite literally saved the world during the Cuban missile crisis.
