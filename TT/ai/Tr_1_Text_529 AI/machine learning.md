
A machine learning algorithm uses an initial data set to build an internal model which it uses to make predictions. It tests these predictions against additional data and uses the results to refine the model.

90% of all the data in existence was created in the last two years.

Turning Big Data into information and thence into understanding and insight is the job of algorithms.

Having more data beats having better data if what you want is to be able to understand, predict and influence the behaviour of large numbers of people.

Traditionally, statisticians started with a hypothesis and went to look for data to support or refute it.
Machine learning, by contrast, starts with data - lots of it - and looks for patterns.

Supermarkets use algorithms to predict what we will collectively want to buy, when and where.
Hospitals use AI to allocate beds.
Telecoms companies, power generators and other utilities use it to manage the load on their resources.
