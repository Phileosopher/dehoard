
Categorize machine learning researchers into five tribes: the symbolists, the evolutionaries, the Bayesians, the analogisers, and the connectionists.
Symbolists = Good Old-Fashioned AI.
Evolutionists start with a group of possible solutions to a problem and produce a second "generation" by introducing small random changes and removing the least effective solutions.
Bayesians make hypotheses about uncertain situations and updates its degree of belief in each hypothesis according to a mathematical rule when new evidence is provided.
Analogisers: new phenomenon is likely to follow the same behaviour as the previously observed phenomenon which is most like it.
Connectionists are trying to reverse engineer the brain by developing artificial neural networks.
Connectionism has been re-branded as deep learning, and it has been the most successful form of machine learning so far.
