
Singularity means a point where the normal rules cease to apply, and what lies beyond is un-knowable to anyone this side of the event horizon.

In math and physics, the term "singularity" means a point at which a variable becomes infinite.
The classic example is the centre of a black hole, where the gravitational field becomes infinite, and the laws of physics cease to operate.
