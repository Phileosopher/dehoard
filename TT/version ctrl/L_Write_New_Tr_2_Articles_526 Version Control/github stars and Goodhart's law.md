(2019) GitHub stars won’t pay your rent
> Solve your own problem, everything else will follow
> However, most developers make zero money off open source. Zero.
> Show your solution to other people as soon as possible
> Package it and distribute it as soon as possible (note to self)
> Don’t be scared, ashamed, or discouraged to make it paid
> Don’t let anyone tell you how much you should charge for your work
> value your work and believe that despite the fact that haters are loud, you’re still gonna get a lot of customers who would gladly pay for what you made.
