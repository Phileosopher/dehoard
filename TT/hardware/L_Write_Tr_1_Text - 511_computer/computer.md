Substrate independence: there are many beautiful examples of it in physics.
Waves, for instance: they have properties such as speed, wavelength and frequency, and physicists can study the equations they obey without even needing to know what particular substance they're waves in. When you hear something, you're detecting sound waves caused by molecules bouncing around in the air, and we can calculate all sorts of interesting things about these waves - how their intensity fades as the square of the distance, such as how they bend when they pass through open doors and how they bounce off of walls and cause echoes - without knowing what air is made of. We can ignore all details about oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc., because the only property of the wave's substrate that matters and enters into the famous wave equation is a single number that we can measure: the wave speed.
This wave equation was first discovered and put to great use long before physicists had even established that atoms and molecules existed.

A wave can travel across a lake, even though none of its water molecules do - they mostly bob up and down, like fans doing "the wave" in a sports stadium.

You can't have computation without matter, but any matter will do as long as it can be arranged into NAND gates, connected neurons or some other building block enabling universal computation.

It's often only the substrate-independent aspect that we're interested in: a surfer usually cares more about the position and height of a wave than about its detailed molecular composition.

Nobody knows for sure what the next blockbuster computational substrate will be, but we do know that we're nowhere near the limits imposed by the laws of physics.
That limit is a whopping 33 orders of magnitude (1033 times) beyond today's state of the art.
Even if we keep doubling the power of our computers every couple of years, it will take over two centuries until we reach that final frontier.
