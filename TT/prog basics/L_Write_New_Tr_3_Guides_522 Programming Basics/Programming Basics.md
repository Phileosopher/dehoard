The hardest part of learning how to program is _not_ learning how a programming language works: it's learning how to _solve problems_ with code.

freeCodeCamp dev quiz - Prog Basics/Features
- what is encapsulation in coding?
- What is a parallel array?
- What is a high order function?
- What's the difference between a "for" and "while" loop?
- The rules that determine the correct structure of the code in a computer program are known as syntax.
- The value of a const variable in JS must be specified when the varible is declared.
- The sequence of statements in a do..while loop runs at least once because the condition is evaluated after running the statements.
- If functions can be sent and received just like values, than that languge is said to have first class functions. They are also called first class citizens.
- An argument is a value passed to a function (or method) when the function or method is called.
- Object destructuring is used to extract an object's values into new variables.
- A special symbol used to perform arithmetic or logical computations is known as operator.
- The rest operator takes the individual arguments passed to a function and converts them into an array.
- The bind function returns a new function with given arguments as the new function's 'this' keyword. [Function.prototype.bind() - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind)
- Each one of the alternative sequence of statements in a conditional statement is known as a branch.
- A computer programming language used for inserting, deleting, and updating data in a database is known as a Data Manipulation Language.
- What is a [Data control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_control_language) language?
- The value undefined is returned by functions that do not have a return statement in JS, but returns None in Python.
- The spread operator can be used to copy portions of an array or object into another array or object.

[GitHub - packing-box/awesome-executable-packing: A curated list of awesome resources related to executable packing](https://github.com/packing-box/awesome-executable-packing)
- _Packing_ is the action of modifying an executable in a way that does not modify its purpose. It is generally one or a combination of the following operations:
	- bundling: makes a single executable with multiple files
	- compression: compresses the executable to reduce its original size
	- encoding: obfuscates the executable by encoding it
	- encryption: obfuscates the executable by encrypting it
	- mutation: alters the executable's code so that it uses a modifided instruction set and architecture (e.g. using oligomorphism)
	- protection: makes the reversing of the executable harder (i.e. using anti-debugging, anti-tampering or other tricks)
	- virtualization: embeds a virtual machine that allows to virtualize executable's instructions
