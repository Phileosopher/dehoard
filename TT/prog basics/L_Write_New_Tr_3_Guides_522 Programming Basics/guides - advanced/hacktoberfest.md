A month-long celebration for open-source projects and official invitation to contribute. Good place to start contributing to real-world projects (e.g. Parity Ethereum, Discord, etc.) and practicing code. If some of the projects are too hard, freeCodeCamp has a place for beginners to start practicing how to contribute (https://guide.freecodecamp.org/). Hacktoberfest mails out free T-shirts and stickers if you make at least 4 pull requests anytime from 1 October - 31 October. During this period, there will also be local meetups, depending on your area.
