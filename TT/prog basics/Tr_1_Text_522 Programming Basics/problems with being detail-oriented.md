
No amount of genius can overcome a preoccupation with detail.

"Out with the details!" Get them out of the code. While we're at it, we can make our code highly configurable and "soft"-that is, easily adaptable to changes.

Think declaratively (specifying what is to be done, not how) and create highly dynamic and adaptable programs. We do this by adopting a general rule: program for the general case, and put the specifics somewhere else-outside the compiled code base.

Because business policy and rules are more likely to change than any other aspect of the project, it makes sense to maintain them in a very flexible format.

Rather than construction, software is more like gardening-it is more organic than concrete.
