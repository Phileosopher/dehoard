
Program deliberately:
Don't code blindfolded. Attempting to build an application you don't fully understand, or to use a technology you aren't familiar with, is an invitation to be misled by coincidences.
Proceed from a plan.
Document your assumptions.
Don't just test your code, but test your assumptions as well. Don't guess; actually try it. Write an assertion to test your assumptions

Are there dusty corners of your primary programming language that you rarely visit?
- Regular expressions are extremely powerful and tragically underutilized.
- Multithreaded programming
- stream libraries
- network programming APIs
- utilities available for dealing with collections or lists?

The more successful you are, the more likely you are to make a fatal mistake. When you've got everything going for you, you're less likely to question your own judgment. When the way you've always done it has always worked, you're less likely to recognize a new way that might work better.

Every wrong note is at most one step away from a right one. What makes improvisations bad is when the improviser doesn't know what to do when the wrong note pops out.

"I don't know" is not a phrase for the insecure.

Heroes never panic.
