
Suppose you wanted to automate code review scheduling and approval. You might put a special marker in each source code file:
/* Status: needs_review */
A simple script could go through all of the source code and look for all files that had a status of needs_review, indicating that they were ready to be reviewed. You could then post a list of those files as a Web page, automatically send e-mail to the appropriate people,

Letting the (automated) wizards have their way leaves your knowledge shallow and leaves you limited to what the wizards can already do for you.
