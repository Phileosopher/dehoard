Every module can have its own unit test built into its code, and these tests can be performed automatically as part of the regular build process.

Tracer code is lean but complete, and forms part of the skeleton of the final system.

What sorts of things might you choose to investigate with a prototype? Anything that carries risk. Anything that hasn't been tried before, or that is absolutely critical to the final system. Anything unproven, experimental, or doubtful. Anything you aren't comfortable with. Its value lies not in the code produced, but in the lessons learned.
