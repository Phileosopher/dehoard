Your knowledge and experience are your most important professional assets. Unfortunately, they're expiring assets. Your knowledge becomes out of date as new techniques, languages, and environments are developed.

Managing a knowledge portfolio is very similar to managing a financial portfolio: Serious investors invest regularly-as a habit. Diversification is the key to long-term success. Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments. Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return. Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically. Buy low, sell high. Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just as rewarding.

Learn at least one new language every year. Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut. If you've used only makefiles and an editor, try an IDE, and vice versa.

Keep the low-level knowledge in the code, where it belongs, and reserve the comments for other, high-level explanations.
