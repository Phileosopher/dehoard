
The success of a project is measured by how well it meets the expectations of its users. A project that falls below their expectations is deemed a failure, no matter how good the deliverable is in absolute terms.

Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations

Some consultants call this process "managing expectations"-actively controlling what users should hope to get from their systems. We think this is a somewhat elitist position. Our role is not to control the hopes of our users. Instead, we need to work with them to come to a common understanding of the development process and the final deliverable, along with those expectations they have not yet verbalized.

If you work closely with your users, sharing their expectations and communicating what you're doing, then there will be few surprises when the project gets delivered. This is a BAD THING. Try to surprise your users. Not scare them, mind you, but delight them. Give them that little bit more than they were expecting. The extra bit of effort it requires to add some user-oriented feature to the system will pay for itself time and time again in goodwill. Listen to your users as the project progresses for clues about what features would really delight them.

He had this uncanny ability to predict what you were going to ask him to do and do it before you thought of it. It was like magic. He was only doing things that I had already said I wanted. I had just said them in ways that were subtle enough that even I didn't realize I had said them.

Mind reading not only applies to your managers but also to your customers. If they're giving you the right cues, you might be able to add features that they're either going to ask for or would have asked for if they had realized they were possible.

Start making some notes about what you think your users and managers are going to ask for. Be creative. Try to see the system from their points of view.
