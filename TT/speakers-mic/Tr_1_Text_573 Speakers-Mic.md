early tests of analog recordings compared to digital ones revealed that
music played back on a CD format had much less of a positive impact on
depressed patients than the same recording played back on a record.
Other tests showed that digitally recorded sound moved the air in a room
significantly differently than analog recordings played through the same
speakers. The bodies in that room would, presumably, also experience
that difference-even if we humans can't immediately put a name or metric
on exactly what that difference is.

MAKE SURE TO CLARIFY HOW MIDI CONTROLLERS WORK

[Discrete cosine transform - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform)

- already on TT Files

NOTE: bring up electrostatic speakers

NOTE: bring up microphone types: ribbon, etc.

bring up MIDI and how it corresponds to music production

bring up audio trackers and how they're basically drag/drop interface along a chronological sequencing
- i.e., each sound effect/loop is essentially atomized, then put together to make the song

MUSIC HAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECT
technically, ALL the music that will ever be popular has been made
- the only difference is that they permute some things to make it "new":
  - change the tempo, usually faster
  - change out instruments
  - play multiple harmonies together
