I hadn't thought of a significant risk from the service provider that comes through the word "unlimited":

1. If a website provides unlimited storage+domains+sites+bandwidth, they can't fulfill that promise in any literal sense.
2. To offset that promise, they sell the product at a premium to the 80% Pareto distribution who _won't_ use the promised service to the fullest of its ability (e.g., what [insurance companies](https://notageni.us/insurance/) do).
    - reductionist e.g., if 20% of the users burn up $100/month in hosting needs, and the other 80% burn up $1/month, they break even at $20.80, meaning they'll sell it at $30/month and come out ahead.
3. As long as _many_ people use the product without taking full advantage of the "unlimited" service, things are fine.
4. However, if for whatever reason more people use that unlimited service, the pricing will have to change.
5. But, it's not always easy to compete with pricing, since _other_ hosting providers are promising the same thing, and migrating a hosted system isn't anywhere _near_ as much trouble as building it.
6. None of the solutions are great, and someone will be unhappy. Prices go up, covered services goes down, they go out of business, or some horrifying combination of the three.

There are 2 good workarounds to this Bad Marketing Promise:

1. Put a general hard limit, which allows their risk assessment to factor the cost and never worry about changing promises later (e.g., [Cloudways](https://www.cloudways.com/)). You can basically do what everyone else does, but it keeps you honest and you won't ruin the customers' lives later.
2. Charge per-item, per-piece, at a _very_ low profit margin (e.g., [NearlyFreeSpeech.NET](https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/)). This requires your customers to be abnormally tech-savvy.
