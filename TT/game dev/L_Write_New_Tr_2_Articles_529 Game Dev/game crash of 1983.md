    - 1977 - Atari made the VCS console, the biggest seller of the era.

    - Game developers were not credited, all games show as made by Atari.

    - Warren Robinet is credited with the first video game Easter Egg after hiding his name on a hidden screen in the game “Adventure” which nobody at Atari spotted before release.

    - Developers of the time were making the whole product, game, boxart, manual etc.

    - David Crane led something of a mutiny and asked for developers to be credited and rewarded based on their own games’ success.

    - Ray Kassar told the mutineers that they were no more important to Atari than the guy on the production line who put the game in the box, they may as well be “….towel designers. Anybody can make a cartridge!”

    - David Crane calculated his games alone brought Atari around $20m compared to his $20,000 salary.

    - The four (David Crane, Larry Kaplan, Alan Miller and Bob Whitehead), left Atari and formed Activision in 1979 and made games for the Atari console.

    - Atari sued Activision saying that only Atari can make games for the Atari.

    - Activision won the case and third-party game developers were born and sprung up everywhere.

    - Now that anybody could make games, lots did and the quality of games generally slipped.

    - Notably, a highly anticipated version of Pac-Man was panned despite selling very well, over 8m copies, however Atari produced around 13m copies (more than the number of consoles sold).

    - To coincide with the launch of the movie E.T., Atari made a game based on the movie but had only six weeks to do it.

    - The game was terrible and was thought to be broken because E.T. would keep falling into pits in the forest.

    - Most E.T. games were returned and buyers’ confidence had waned. Other competitors were now doing better than Atari.

    - Atari took the returned and unsold E.T. cartridges, consoles and other items to a landfill in New Mexico and crushed and buried them.

    - This was a mythical tale for years until 2014 when they were dug up again as part of a documentary.

    - Some had survived the crushing and became collectors’ items (along with many eBay fakes sold in bags of soil).

    - The documentary is called Atari: Game Over and is worth a watch.

    - A band called Wintergreen also told the story of the burial in their music video “When I Wake Up” Great song! ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_AOPxZHPfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_AOPxZHPfE))

    - Around 1983 the whole industry crashed and did not reappear until October 1985 when Nintendo test launched the NES in America before a full launch in 1986.

    - Each NES game carried a badge called the “Nintendo Seal of Approval” as each game could only be published via Nintendo.

    - Third party developers were licensed and given credit on their games.

    - Interestingly, with me being in the UK, we never felt the crash as most of the UK used 8bit computers (C64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro) rather than consoles, and the computer scene was booming all through that period.

    - As a result, the NES did not do all that well in the UK but it definitely revived the US market.

    - Incidentally, the BBC Micro story is also an interesting one and is told very well in a movie called “Micro Men” that you can easily find.

    - Again, that story is told in a music video by a great band called “The British IBM” ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCyLLFNh24E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCyLLFNh24E))
