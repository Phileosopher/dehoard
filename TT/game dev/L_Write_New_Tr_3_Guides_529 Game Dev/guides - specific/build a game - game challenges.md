In 2005, the roguelike community established a yearly event, the 7DRL Challenge, in which developers are challenged to create a roguelike in seven days. This allows one to have the shared misery of knowing you are not the only one tracking down a bad pointer at the 167th hour. The annual event occurs during a week in early March.
