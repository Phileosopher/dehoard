FROM BEN CROSHAW:
- games don't have to be "fun" (relative word and doesn't capture the range of experiences), but it DOES have to be "engaging"
- the 3 Cs of gaming:
    - Context - a [symbolic] relationship to something else
    - Challenge - a provocation to find [meaning] through accomplishing a [purpose]
    - Catharsis - the profound joy of accomplishing or experiencing something in the present
    - At least 1 of the 3 at any moment in time is necessary for a great gaming experience
    - Most modern games are basically nothing but "all catharsis, all the time"

- make sure to indicate how a "gameplay loop" ends up working (i.e., reproduces [habits] through a "cycle")

Gamplay loop: a game must create a flowing loop that manifests a catharsis inside that loop
- boomer shooters are effectively feeling severe efficiency
- arcade games have people feeling improvement (via higher scores each time)

BE SURE TO ADDRESS STRATEGY GAMES

[Great Detective Games Let You Fail Miserably - Extra Punctuation](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/great-detective-games-let-you-fail-miserably-extra-punctuation/)
- games need to let the player fail, and fail spectacularly
- that failure magnifies the success if the player is willing to push through it
- it's the singular reason why people nostalgically remember Nintendo/Capcom titles from the late 80's.
