
The trouble with game engines is that they will likely deprecate
- when they're no longer supported, the games that they supported will also suffer
- the only solution is to have a well-established archive of the game AND the engine, or have it decompiled and reworked into modern OS
- for financial profit reasons, many games disappear entirely in their native form and often only exist as remastered editions by game developers
