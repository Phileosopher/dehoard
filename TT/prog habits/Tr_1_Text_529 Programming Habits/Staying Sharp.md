To stay employed, you must be seen as a vital part of the company. This comes by your fulfilling several things at once:

1. Your skills are relevant to your manager's needs.
2. Your manager thinks you're a better alternative than anyone they could interview in the wild.
3. You're too important to lose.

Many tech workers try to satisfy #3 at the expense of #2 by making it arbitrarily difficult to follow what they're doing, such as making overly complicated [algorithms](https://icould.fail/algorithms/) or maintaining an inferior platform or codebase instead of using something easier.

However, the wiser way to keep yourself employed is to do what nobody else _wants_ to do. It's higher-risk and sometimes more unpleasant, but making your boss happy with your willingness to take on hard challenges will also make your boss afraid of losing you.

Some of these unpleasant things will never be fashionable to tech workers:

[Software automation](https://icould.fail/prog-habits/)
is _amazing_, but it's not possible to entirely automate everything, and some things are destined to be difficult.
- One of the more crucial components of working on a team is being able to handle [conflicts](https://adequate.life/conflicts/) with your peers and managers well, _not_ just being "really good" at something.

Most people won't want to make the changes because they're often uphill. But, for the rest who take that road, it [builds character](https://gainedin.site/morality/) and makes life more [meaningful](https://gainedin.site/meaning/).

Don't let yourself just be the best in the bunch. Be the person and do the things that people can't not talk about.
