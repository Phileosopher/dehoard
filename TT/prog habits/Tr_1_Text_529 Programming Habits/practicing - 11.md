
When you practice music, it shouldn't sound good. If you always sound good during practice sessions, it means you're not stretching your limits. That's what practice is for.

Can you imagine a professional musician getting onstage and replicating the gibberish from my university's practice rooms? It wouldn't be tolerated. Musicians are paid to perform in public - not to practice.

I started experimenting with programming exercises modeled after my musical practice sessions.
Rule number one was that the software I was developing couldn't be something I wanted to use.
I didn't want to cut corners, rushing to an end goal.
So, I wrote software that wasn't useful.
I cut no corners but was frustrated to find that a lot of the ideas I had while practicing weren't working.
Though I was trying to do as good a job as possible, the designs and code I was creating weren't as elegant as I had hoped they'd be.
Looking back on it now, I see that the awkward feeling I got from these experiences was a good sign.
My code wasn't completely devoid of brilliant moments. But I was stretching my mental muscles and building my coding chops.

Practice at your limits.

Got any favorite pieces of open source software? How about trying to add a feature?
Go look at the to-do list for a piece of software you'd like to practice with, and give yourself a constrained amount of time to implement the new feature.

This is an exercise you can practice often and in short periods of time. You don't actually have to implement the feature. Just use it as a starting point. The real goal is to understand what you're looking at as quickly as possible. Be sure to vary the software you work with. Try different types of software in different styles and languages. Take note of issues that make it easier or harder for you to find your way around.
What patterns are you developing that help you work through the code?
What virtual bread crumbs do you leave for yourself to help you navigate as you move up and down the call stack of a complex piece of functionality?

A great way to sharpen the mind and improve your improvisational coding skills is to practice with self-imposed constraints.
Pick a simple program, and try to write it with these constraints.
My favorite exercise is to write a program that prints the lyrics to the tired old song "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall."
How could you write such a program without doing any variable assignments?

How fast can you code this program?
How about practicing small, difficult problems with a timer?

Code Kata, which are small, thought-provoking exercises that programmers can do in the language of their choice. Each kata emphasizes a specific technique or thought process, providing a concrete flexing of one's mental muscles. Work through all twenty-one kata.

Listening to music, therefore, is not a passive activity for a jazz musician. It is study. Furthermore, the ability to understand what you're hearing is a skill that you develop over time.

Studying the work of masters is an essential part of becoming a master.
