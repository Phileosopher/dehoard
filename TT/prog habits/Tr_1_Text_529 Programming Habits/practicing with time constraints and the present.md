The sad thing is that even when you don't want it to be this way, you can fall into the trap, especially when there are tasks you don't really want to do.
In the case of a weekend coding race, you don't have time to put tasks off, so you don't.
You can't delay making a decision, so you don't.
You can't avoid the boring work, and you know that you have to do it so quickly that nothing can get too boring.

A sense of urgency, even if manufactured, is enough to easily double or triple your productivity. Try it, and you'll see. You can do it faster. You can do it now. You can get it done instead of talking about getting it done. If you treat your projects like a race, you'll get to the end a lot faster.

Keeping your mind focused on the present will get you further toward your goals than keeping your mind focused on the goal.

If you're always walking around with your head in the clouds, You'll always be waiting for the big one while ignoring the little things that happen every day.

What if you tried to do the boring stuff perfectly?

Martin renamed forty-hour workweek to "eight-hour burn." The idea is that you should work so relentlessly that there is no way that you could continue longer than eight hours. When you have too much time to work, your work time reduces significantly in perceived value. If you have seventy hours available, each hour is less precious to you than when you have forty hours available. Eight-hour burn places a constraint on you and gives you a strategy for dealing with that constraint. You get to work and think, I've only got eight hours! Go, go, go!

If you work intensely every day, you'll find that the work doesn't follow you home. Not only are you deliberately stopping yourself from working after-hours, but your mind will actually allow you to stop working after-hours.

Chris would actually plan down to how he was going to use the fifteen minutes between classes to fit in practice routines that could be done quickly.
