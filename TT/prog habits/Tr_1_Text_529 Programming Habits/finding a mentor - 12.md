
Always try to be the worst musician in the band.
Find a "be the worst" situation for yourself.

Ask old-timers to review your code and make suggestions that would make it more idiomatically correct.

A mentor is someone you can trust enough to ask, "What should be different about me as a professional?"

Not only do you create a personal attachment and responsibility to your mentor, but the reverse happens as well. If my role in a relationship is to help someone, I become invested in that person's success.

Nobody has to explicitly ask someone to be their mentor.

Your mentor may not even know they are serving that role for you.

Think of the person in your field whom you admire most.
List the ten most important attributes of this role model.
Choose the attributes that are the reason why you have chosen this person to be your role model.
Rank those qualities in order of importance.
You have now created and distilled a list of attributes that you find admirable and important.
These are the ways in which you should strive to emulate your chosen role model.

For each item on the list, imagine how your role model would rate you on a scale of 1 to 10
Subtract your rating in each row from the importance level you gave it.
That gives you a final priority score

He was just a high-school kid. But, he was already playing gigs, substituting for Little Rock's most respected jazz pianists. Chris was pretty good - especially for his age - but he wasn't that good. It didn't take me long to understand what was happening. When the band we were watching took a set break, Chris would break mid-sentence and just walk away from me to go talk to the band members. He was pushy as hell and would always ask if he could sit in with the band, no matter how inappropriate it seemed to me. He would also ask the musicians for lessons, which meant that he would go to their houses, listen to music, and chat about jazz improvisation with them.

I've seen the same pattern in people I've met in classical music, the American Tibetan Buddhist community, software development.

Really good people won't mind if you want to know them. People like to be appreciated, and they like to talk about the topics they are passionate about. The fact that they are the professional or the guru or the leader or the renowned author doesn't change that they're human and like to interact with other humans.

The gurus are the supernodes in the social and professional network. All it takes to make the connection is a little less humility.
