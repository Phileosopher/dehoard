There is no hidden source code for a painting or a piece of music. If you can hear the music or see the piece of art, you can learn from it.

As you look at this code with a critical eye, you will start to develop your own tastes, just as you would for music, art, or literature. Various styles and devices will amuse you, amaze you, anger you, and (I hope) challenge you.

You will learn more about what already exists.

Pick a project, and read it like a book.
Make notes. Outline the good and the bad.
Write a critique, and publish it.

Find at least one bad thing that you observed that you will add to your "What not to do" checklist.

You should read good code.

You have to actively copy, widely and unashamedly. This applies to a lot of things, of course. Hunter S. Thompson didn't just read good books; he typed out Hemingway and Fitzgerald.
