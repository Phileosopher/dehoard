
Martin Fowler said that whenever he wants to really learn about something, he writes about it.

To really learn something, try teaching it to someone else. There's no better way to crystallize your understanding of something than to force yourself to express it to someone else so that they can understand it.

We internally work through the reasons why one analogy seems to work but doesn't and another analogy would seem not to work but does. When you teach, you have to answer questions that may have never occurred to you.

Helping someone is a job you can't be laid off from.
