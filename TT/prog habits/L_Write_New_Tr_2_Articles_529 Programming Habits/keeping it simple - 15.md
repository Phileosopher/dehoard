Second System Syndrome
a simple system is doomed to be replaced by an excessively abstract, over-engeered, or bloated successor.

> When dealing with build tools, a few things become apparent:
> * if you make the build tool simple, it won't handle all the weird edge cases that exist out there
> * if you want to handle the weird edge cases, you need to deviate from whatever norm you wanted to establish
> * if you want ease of use for common defaults, the rules for common defaults must be shared between the tool and the users, who shape their systems to fit the tool's expectations
> * if you allow configuration or scripting, you give the users a way to specify the rules that must be shared, so the tool fits their systems
> * if you want to keep the tool simple, you have to force your users to only play within the parameters that fit this simplicity
> * if your users' use cases don't map well to your simplicity, they will build shims around your tool to attain their objectives

> * Fewer moving parts. It’s easier to create more robust systems and to fix things when they do go wrong.
> * Small software is faster. Fewer bits to download and clog your computer’s memory.
> * Reduced power consumption. This is important on a “save the planet” scale, but also on the very local scale of increasing the battery life of your phone and laptop.
> * The light, frugal aesthetic. That’s personal, I know, but as you’ll see, I’m not alone.
