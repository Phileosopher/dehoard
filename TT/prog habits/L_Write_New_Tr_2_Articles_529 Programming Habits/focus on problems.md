(2021) Think first about what problem this is solving and for whom
> every time you pick up a new Jira ticket or sit down to complete a new requirement, I suggest that you ask yourself the following questions: 
> * Who does this solve a problem for? 
> * What is the problem theyâ€™re trying to solve? 
> * How does this ticket solve it?
