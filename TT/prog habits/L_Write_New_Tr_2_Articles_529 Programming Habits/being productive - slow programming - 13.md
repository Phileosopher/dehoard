How doing less can help you be more productive
> * Focus on results; not time : Time tracking is unavoidable in some instances, but rather than the rule by which companies operate, it should be used as a secondary metric to the results they achieve. Rather than give an employee a 2-hour window to do a job, have her do it right the first time (bonus points for documenting the process), then review and adjust your future plans based on time tracking data.
> * Improve systems : Improving systems helps remove busywork from an employee’s day, but it also makes things easier for the customer. 
> * Whether you’re getting a lot of satisfaction from being busy or just feeling exasperated, don’t forget to occasionally stop and ask yourself: Is this the best use of time?

(2012) A Gentle Friday Reminder: Go Slow
> * You are moving too fast. Overwhelmed with everything, good or bad, happening around.
> * Life is too short (really) to zoom past it.
> * People who survive (and grow) are the ones who stay in the moment, concentrate and strive to deliver their best.
> * Quality never comes from rushing through things.
> * Just because you can do so many things doesn’t mean you should attempt all of them.
> * Rushing too fast through these is a risk, it is a killer. You never savor the moment, be in the present and enjoy the process. You end up ‘doing’ so much that there is no time to ‘ruminate’

Programming has become a pursuit of profit over personal knowledge. The craft of programming has developed into a rapid rush to the finish line via bootcamps and brief tutorials.
