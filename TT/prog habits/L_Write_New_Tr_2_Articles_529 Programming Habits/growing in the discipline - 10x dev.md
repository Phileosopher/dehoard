(2016) Evil tip: avoid "easy" things
> To a very large extent, [your productivity is a result of what you choose to work on](https://yosefk.com/blog/10x-more-selective.html). Keep things perceived as easy out of that list. When you can't, postponing an "easy" thing can make it both "harder" and smaller.

> So I believe, having authored a lot of code that went down the toilet, that you don't get productive by working as much as by not working – not on stuff that is likely to get thrown away.

(2020) The Myth of the Myth of the 10x Programmer
> * I think 10x developers, like world-class athletes, musicians, and authors, absolutely do exist. You’re just not going to find them with a coding test.
> * Highly productive developers (10x or otherwise) are problem-solving at a much higher level.

(2018) There’s always more work to do—but you still don’t need to work long hours
> Whenever you feel yourself with too much work to do, go back and apply these principles: underpromise, limit your own time, prioritize ruthlessly. With practice you’ll learn how to deliver the results that really matter—without working long hours.
