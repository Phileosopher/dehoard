I am going to provide you with a few paragraphs at a time of [writing type, i.e. fiction, nonfiction] writing (it's an [genre and publication type, i.e. adventure sci-fi novel]), and I want you to rewrite it in the style of a bestselling [genre] author (for example, similar to someone like [author name] or someone who has won [award name]). The language used should have a strong focus on emotion and intensity, and use evocative descriptions and rich sensory details to create a feeling of atmosphere and immersion. Use strong power words when possible. Avoid passive verbs and make sure to "show, don't tell." The writing should flow smoothly, while varying sentence and paragraph length appropriately. Make sure the output uses correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation according to the Chicago Manual of Style. The output should have a Fleisch Reading Ease Score higher than [insert appropriate score for your audience]. Each time I provide a new selection of paragraphs, follow these instructions, but do not reference previously provided paragraphs, treat each new section of text as if you're starting from scratch. Do you understand?
