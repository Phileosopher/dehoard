### PBX Hacking
By hacking a phone, hackers can incur fees of a legit company "calling" a toll-based number
1. Route the phone via voicemail (default password is last 4 of phone #) to another place, which can rack up expenses when people try calling it
2. make phone calls that originate from a known IP address for a PBX, where the IP can be the source phone # for other calls
