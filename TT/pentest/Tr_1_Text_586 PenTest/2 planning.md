One not-too-uncommon approach to distribute less-than-legitimate software and content online is to intentionally get neighboring websites:
- (use actual example) barbecuetips.com might be an amazing site for BBQ-related tips, so hackers will take up barbbecuetips.com, bbqtips.com, barbecuetips.co, barbecuetips.net, and so on
- one of the most successful was whitehouse.com during the Clinton years, which was a porn site.
