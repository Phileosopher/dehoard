tip Overall Strategy

Diversify your analysis approach.

Don't rely on the results from a single tool.

Run everything with as few privileges as necessary.

APT investigations must be seperated from commodity malware, otherwise you give malware authors "ideas".

Treat everything like it could be malicious until you have enough evidence to suggest otherwise.
