[XZ backdoor: "It's RCE, not auth bypass, and gated/unreplayable." | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39877267)
[Filippo Valsorda: "I'm watching some folks reverse engineer the xz backdoor, sharing some *preliminary* analysis with permission. The hooked RSA_public_decrypt verifies a signature on the server's host key by a fixed Ed448 key, and then passes a payload to system(). It's RCE, not auth bypass, and gated/unreplayable." - Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/filippo.abyssdomain.expert/post/3kowjkx2njy2b)
