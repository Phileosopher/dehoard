
A way to get quick and dirty load balancing among multiple consumer processes: the hungry consumer model. In a hungry consumer model, you replace the central scheduler with a number of independent consumer tasks and a centralized work queue. Each consumer task grabs a piece from the work queue and goes on about the business of processing it. As each task finishes its work, it goes back to the queue for some more. This way, if any particular task gets bogged down, the others can pick up the slack, and each individual component can proceed at its own pace. Each component is temporally decoupled from the others. Tip 40 Design Using Services Instead of components, we have really created services-independent, concurrent objects behind well-defined, consistent interfaces.
