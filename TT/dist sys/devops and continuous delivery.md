Jenkins World 2017: The Ten Commandments Of Continuous Delivery
* do pull requests
* prioritize
* finish what you're doing, focus on a small number of tasks in parallel.
* delegate some work to others if you already have lot of work to achieve, so you have more time to work on what matters for you

    You Are Not Google
  * Don’t even start considering solutions until you **Understand** the problem. Your goal should be to “solve” the problem mostly within the problem domain, not the solution domain.
  * **enumerate** multiple candidate solutions. Don’t just start prodding at your favorite!
  * Consider a candidate solution, then read the **Paper** if there is one.
  * Determine the **Historical context** in which the candidate solution was designed or developed.
  * Weigh **Advantages** against disadvantages. Determine what was de-prioritized to achieve what was prioritized.
  * **Think!** Soberly and humbly ponder how well this solution fits your problem. What fact would need to be different for you to change your mind? For instance, how much smaller would the data need to be before you’d elect not to use Hadoop?
