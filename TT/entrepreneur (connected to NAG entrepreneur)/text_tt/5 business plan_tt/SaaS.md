- SaaS is a MAJOR non-thing for many people, but it sounds cool
- it feeds the business owner's ego, but isn't often a great business model because it collapses as soon as someone (open-sources) it.
- "market insights" is business jargon bullshit
- machine learning algos don't help: they're inherently (biased) by their creator, and are so niche that 99.999999% of the population won't ever WANT it
- further, if you make something generally useful, someone else can make a more specifically useful product on your generally useful platform, rendering you irrelevant, extra points if it was (FLOSS) because you lose ANY market edge
