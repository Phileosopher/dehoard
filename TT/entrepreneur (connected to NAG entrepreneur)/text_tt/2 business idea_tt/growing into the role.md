Every technician suffering from an Entrepreneurial Seizure experiences the same thing:
1. Exhiliration
2. Terror
3. Exhaustion
4. Despair - a terrible sense of loss, loss of special relationship with their work, loss of purpose, loss of self.

Everybody who goes into business is actually three people in one:
The Entrepreneur dreams
The Manager frets
The Technician ruminates
While each of these personalities wants to be the boss, none of them wants to have a boss.

The Entrepreneur lives in the future, never in the past, rarely in the present. He's happiest when left free to construct images of "what if" and "if when".
In business, the Entrepreneur is the innovator, grand strategist, creator of new methods.
Given his need for change, the Entrepreneur creates a great deal of havoc around him, which is predictably unsettling for those he enlists in his projects.
The entrepreneur builds a house and the instant it's done begins planning the next one.

The Manager craves order, compulsively clings to the status quo. While entrepreneur sees opportunities, manager sees the problems.
The Manager creates neat orderly rows of things. The Entrepreneur creates the things that the manager puts in rows.
The Manager is the one who runs after the Entrepreneur to clean up the mess. Without the Entrepreneur there would be no mess to clean up.

Technician is the doer : "if you want something done right, do it yourself".
As long as the Technician is working, he is happy, but only on one thing at a time. He knows he can't get things done simultaneously, so he works steadily and is happiest when he is in control of the work flow.

If the three were equally balanced, we'd be describing an incredibly competent individual.
The Entrepreneur would be free to forge ahead into new areas of interest.
The Manager would be solidifying the base of operations.
The Technician would be doing the technical work.

Without all three of these personalities being given opportunity, the freedom, the nourishment they each need to grow, your business cannot help but mirror your own lopsidedness.

An Entrepreneur does the work of envisioning the business as something apart from you, the owner. The work of asking all the right questions about WHY this business, opposed to that business?

Franchise prototype is where all assumptions are put to the test to see how well they work before becoming operational in the business.
The system runs the business. The people run the system.
The system isn't something you bring to the business. It's something you derive from the process of building the business.
Entrepreneur : franchise prototype is the medium through which vision takes form in the real world.
Manager : franchise prototype provides the order, predictability, system.
Technician : franchise prototype is where he is free to do the things he loves to do : the technical work.
