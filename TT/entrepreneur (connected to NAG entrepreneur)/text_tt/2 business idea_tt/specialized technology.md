
Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have.

Proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimension to lead to a real monopolistic advantage. Anything less than an order of magnitude better will probably be perceived as a marginal improvement and will be hard to sell,

The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite.

If you can develop technology that's simply too hard for competitors to
duplicate, you don't need to rely on other defenses. Start by picking a
hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice.

THE TURN-KEY REVOLUTION
A systems-dependent business, not a people-dependent business.
Integrity : doing what you say you will do, and if you can't : learning how.
