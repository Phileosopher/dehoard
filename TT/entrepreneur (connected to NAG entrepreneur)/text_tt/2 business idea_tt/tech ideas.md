
Most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.

Success Secrets of Tomorrow's Internet:
1. Relentless Execution 
2. Resistance to Compromise
3. What you don't do. (best new net companies understand in their heart & soul what they won't do)
4. Desire to be 3 steps ahead (not just 2)
5. Doing something worth doing
6. Connecting people to people
7. Monetizing from the first moment. (You can't charge money if the only reason you're charging is to make a profit. Charing adds friction and selectivity. If those two elements are a drag on your service, you will fail.)
8. Not depending on a big partner
9. Ignoring the pundits
10. Keeping promises

Fatal assumption : if you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work.
The technical work of a business, and a business that does that technical work are two totally different things.
The technician is forced to learn how to make the business work, rather than do the work himself.
