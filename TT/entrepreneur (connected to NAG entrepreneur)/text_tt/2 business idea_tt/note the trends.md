Make a service business on whatever the cutting edge of the Internet is.
Start with small businesses. In the '90s, you would've made a website
business. Right now you can build an app or make a social media agency.
Don't just set up Facebook fan pages for people. Get those people some
fans. Set people up on twitter. Then get those people followers. Once
you have a few hundred thousand in revenues and you start hiring people,
sell the business for $1 million. That's it. There will be plenty of
buyers (local ad agencies, bigger ad agencies trying to consolidate,
bigger social media firms, small public companies trying to break into
the ad space).
