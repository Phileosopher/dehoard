
My business - the information business - revolves around the public's stubborn belief that there must be a "secret" to success, concealed from them, possibly by conspiracy, that if uncovered, would change everything.

The domain of "information" is tricky, and you can only make money a few ways:
1. selling raw information (e.g., government is a huge purchaser of key intel)
    - there's plenty of money in it, but it often can be [unethical]
    - it can also be free in our [overinformation society](mypurpose)
2. sending information (e.g., advertising, journalism)
    - the information is often undesired, especially in our [overinformation society](mypurpose)
3. giving your own specially-curated information for a fee (e.g., educators, AI services)
    - your ideas aren't THAT special, and it'll get stolen/pirated once it's out there
4. restricting information (e.g., cybersecurity)
    - it's a security-based service you're providing, which is something totally different
5. hosting a means of others providing information (e.g., social media, sitebuilders)
    - it's a reliable service that revolves around free expression of information
- these can also all be [FLOSS] or [donationware](NPO)

Vaporware. This term refers to the tactic of announcing a software
product before it exists, typically to discourage rivals from proceeding
with development of competing versions.
