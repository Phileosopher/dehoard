Outside developer made : An instant-messaging application that enables IM users to ping Amazon with a request and have it message you back with links to relevant products.

Amazon Web Services give developers access to numerous Amazon software services, like its shopping cart, and every fragment of data they could wish for, including text for product descriptions and reviews, product images, and pricing information. AWS evangelist Jeff Barr calls these the fundamental building blocks that external developers use to construct applications.

Developers can build any application they see fit. No one has to ask for permission or await approval. No haggling over specs or schedules.

Amazon has a head start in a wide variety of areas such as pricing transparency, RSS advertising, and comparison shopping. RefundPlease uses Amazon's own pricing info to inform customers if an item they've purchased drops within 30 days of purchase. Amazon will refund the difference to boost loyalty.

The more data we're able to put in the hands of developers, the more interesting tools, sites, applications will be built, and the more of those that exist, the greater the return to Amazon. We're going to see more traffic, more clicks, and ultimately more purchases. It's not just a science experiment.

Hiking Outpost: a specialist book retailer aggregates info about trails and camping sites from around the web, and Amazon handles credit-card processing, order shipping, and returns. Referral fees are 4-7.5%, based on the total number of items shipped.

Amazon enhances its competitiveness because there is now less incentive for competitors to build a competing platform when they can leverage Amazon's for free. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

Once a platform like Google, Amazon, or SAP gains traction, there is less and less incentive for people to defect to other platforms. The trend is self-reinforcing. More developers create better offerings, attracting more customers.

Sharing makes sense if the conditions are right:
- Your proprietary offering is failing and open sourcing it could inject the creativity and manpower required to make it succeed in the marketplace. (Sun OpenSparc.)
- Opening up IP in one area could boost demand for complementary product and services offerings. (IBM WebSphere.)
- Advantages of pooling competencies and reducing R&D exceed benefits of having exclusive rights to the knowledge produced. (SNP Consortium.)
- You're seeking a uniquely qualified mind so you enlarge the pool of talent addressing a particular problem. (Goldcorp)
- An open platform will encourage innovation, efficiency, and interoperability with ecosystem partners. (Amazon)
- Sharing is necessary to establish credentials and to develop relationships with other contributors in the community. (SpikeSource)
- Preempting the property rights of competitors shifts the locus of competition or enhances your freedom of action. (Merck's Gene index.)
- Openness removes unnecessary friction in collaborative projects and paves the way for participants to focus on the science (Intel's industry-university partnership)
Imagine a digital age co-op, with peer-rating systems that dynamically apportion shares to contributors based on the community's assessment of the value added by individual contributors. Annual profits from sales and services could be distributed across the community of contributors.
