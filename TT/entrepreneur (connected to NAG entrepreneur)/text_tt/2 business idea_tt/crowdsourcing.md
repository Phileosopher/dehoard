Ken Thompson made Unix out of small, discrete programs meant to do one thing but to do it well. Such an architecture would eventually allow hundreds of programmers to work together in a totally decentralized fashion - in much the same way thousands of contributors work together today in a decentralized fashion to form a single reference work, Wikipedia. Breaking labor into little units, or modules, is one of the hallmarks of crowdsourcing.

TopCoder - unique model for community based software developement. They broke tasks down into the smallest possible discrete parts, the smaller the block, the more ways they could use it. A Job has to conform to a given individual's "spare cycle", or excess capacity - The hours between work and sleep.

Mathworks (The company that developed MATLAB) - In an office full of developers, if one person solves a problem, everyone else will gather around to see how they did it, have their "aha" moment, then factor it into their own code. (Context - Matworks held a tourney in the 70s to solve the 'Travelling Salesman Problem' where people would submit algorithms to solve the problem and the most efficient algorithm would be declared the winner. But participants were allowed to steal each other's code in order to create a better solution).

Based on the above, Mathworks noticed that the best algorithm at the end of the contest period exceeds the best algorithm from day one by a magnitude of one thousand.

Active users are rare, but they sit at the top of pyramids of other
people who are working to solve similar problems.
