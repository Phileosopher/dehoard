
NOTE: tech has a disproportionate labor/output compared to most work
In most work:
- 500 hours creates 500 units
- 800 hours creates 1000 units
- 1500 hours creates 2500 units
- It scales proportionally based on reality and improved [productivity]

In tech work:
- 500 hours creates 10 units
- 800 hours creates 200 units
- 1500 hours creates 10,000 units
- It scales exponentially as the technology starts working
- The problem is that you need 10,000 units to break even, and investors get anxious watching

Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is
measured by number of users.
