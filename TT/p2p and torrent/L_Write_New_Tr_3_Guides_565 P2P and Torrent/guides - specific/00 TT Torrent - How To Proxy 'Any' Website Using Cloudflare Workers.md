   BOOM you can access your proxied website at [1337x.subdomain.workers.dev](http://1337x.subdomain.workers.dev)

Enjoy and cheers!

Not all websites can be proxied. Either because the websites don't want to be proxied or because can't be proxied through cloudflare workers or because cloudflare itself doesn't support them.

Leaving some sample workers. Feel free to use them.
