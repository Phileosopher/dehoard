  Install Trollinstaller via services like
  [AltStore](https://altstore.io/)
  [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)
  etc.

  Open Trollinstaller, click on "Install" Button & wait for it to be finished.

  If your phone reboots here, go back to previous step.

  An alert should pop up when TrollStore installed successfully, click close and the app should exit.

  If TrollStore is on home screen, start it. If not, then reboot and it should appear afterwards. Then start it.

  Go into the settings tab, hit "Install ldid" so TrollStore can install unsigned apps.

  Tap "Install Persistence Helper" and choose a system app you don't need to use (e.g. Tips or Home) in the list that appears.

  Optional : You now may delete "Trollinstaller" app if you see "TrollStore" on your homepage.

  Next download or save an iPA file to be sideloaded on you iDevice.

Very Important

Save your iPA file in the "On My iPhone/iPad etc." storage and not in "iCloud Drive". Failing to do this step will probably result in failed iPA installation.

  Install the iPA Package by Opening the Share Sheet, and opening the file in "TrollStore".

  Profit.
