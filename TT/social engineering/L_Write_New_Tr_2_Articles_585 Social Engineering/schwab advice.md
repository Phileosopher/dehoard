Stay safe this tax season: Your guide to preventing check fraud.

As we step into tax season, it's crucial to stay vigilant against financial crimes that could affect your financial security and peace of mind.

Check fraud, which involves illegal activities like forging, stealing, altering, or creating counterfeit checks, is a prevalent issue, especially during tax season. It's important to be aware of how this can happen, the signs to look out for, and understanding how to mitigate the associated risks.
Here are six tips you can use to protect yourself and your assets:
1. Sign up for USPS email alerts:
Use the USPS's Informed Delivery service for daily emails on incoming mail. It's free at USPS.com.
2. Request direct deposits:
Instead of receiving physical checks, request direct deposits into your account. It's safer and quicker.
3. Pay bills electronically:
For added security, use electronic or mobile payment methods like e-checks or ACH payments.
4. Track your checks:
Follow up on undelivered checks promptly and notify your financial institution of any missing checks.
5. Reduce outgoing mail theft:
Take your mail directly to the post office or drop it into a secure mailbox before the last collection.
6. Guard against alterations:
Use permanent black ink and avoid leaving blank spaces on payee or amount lines.

If you suspect fraud:
- Contact your financial institution and local law enforcement to file a report.
- If mail was involved, report it to the United States Postal Inspection Service at uspis.gov/report or call 1-877-876-2455.
