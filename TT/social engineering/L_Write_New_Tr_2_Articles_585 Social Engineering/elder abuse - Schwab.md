At Schwab, we’re dedicated to shedding light on the often unseen and unspoken issue of elder abuse, which includes physical, emotional, and financial mistreatment of older adults. Financial abuse of seniors is a particularly concerning aspect of elder abuse, involving the unauthorized or improper use of an older person's funds, property, or resources.

Here’s what you can do to help protect the seniors in your life:
- Stay informed: Be aware of the common signs of financial exploitation, such as sudden changes in accounts, estate planning documents, or unexplained withdrawals or spending.
- Communicate: Maintain open lines of communication with elderly family members about their financial matters.
- Report suspicions: If you suspect that an elderly person is being financially exploited, it's crucial to report it. You can contact local adult protective services, law enforcement, and financial institutions where they hold accounts.
- Talk about money: Talk to your aging parents about money and creating a financial plan to manage their affairs. Learn more at [Aging Parents? 5 Money Topics to Discuss | Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/aging-parents-5-money-topics-to-discuss).
