Protect yourself from fraud with these tips.
Cybercrime and fraud are serious threats to your personal information, and lately scams are on the rise. Please use caution when discussing your Ally accounts over the phone or via text message as you could be interacting with a scammer, disguised as an Ally employee.

Keep in mind, while we do make follow-up calls occasionally, we don't call or text our customers out of the blue.

Tips to protect yourself:

    Deny requests for a password. We don't call or text you and ask for your Ally account password to verify your account. These scammers will.
    Ask questions. Asking questions like "When's the last time I called you?" may prompt the fraudster to hang up.
    Call us directly and report fraud. If someone calls or texts you for your Ally Bank information, don't respond and call us at 1-833-226-1520 to report it.
    Stay aware. Fraudsters are constantly changing the ways they try to cheat you out of your money. Learn how to protect yourself against the latest smishing and social media scams.
