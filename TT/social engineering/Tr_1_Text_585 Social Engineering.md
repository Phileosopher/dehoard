In a hostile, depersonalized net environment, identity is one's
liability. What were the kids' weapons against me? My name, my address,
my home. What does putting a picture of someone's house online really
imply, after all? We know where you live. We can get you, the real
you-while you have no idea who we are.

the anonymous status of people in an online group engenders crowd
behavior. They have nothing to fear as individuals, and get used to
taking actions from a distance and from secrecy. As a result, they
exacerbate digital technology's most dehumanizing tendencies, and end up
behaving angrily, destructively, and automatically. They go from being
people to being a mob.

The way to dampen the effects of this problem is not to retreat into
anonymity ourselves, but to make being real and identifiable the norm.
As in the real world, the fewer people who know each other, the more
dangerous the neighborhood.

The real way to "go social," if they wanted to, would not be to
accumulate more page friends or message followers, but rather to get
their friends and followers to befriend and follow one another. That's
how to create a culture in a peer-to-peer, networked medium.
