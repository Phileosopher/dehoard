there is great utility in technological things
- pacemakers and subdermal blood sugar sensors can save lives

however, Babel exists as a cautionary tale for all of us
- our desire to grow bigger, better, faster, and more is essentially an implementation of our wiring for [meaning], but imposed onto an endless canvas of gaining [power] for power's sake

therefore, the [purpose] for why we gain anything "transhuman" should be out of love for others
- get a life-saving treatment because you want your family to enjoy the benefit of you being around (you're only delaying the inevitable death of your flesh anyway)
- DON'T get cosmetic "upgrades" like gene-splicing for eye color or nail implants
- be careful about domains such as embedded visual assistance or a subdermal watch/monitor
  - they may seem neat, but you're sabotaging a perfectly high-quality system God designed, and are trusting that [Big Tech] won't abuse the power they give you

What we do with tech is not important, but WHY we do it and TO WHAT END matters completely
