make a note about the "quantified self", and how it's not necessarily more meaningful
- they find meaning in (certainty), but that doesn't directly translate to something that positively impacts society
- certainty is good, but only to a point

- the idea is that the abstractions can be infinite, but that's simply not true
- complete automation is impossible, and ANY permutation requires retooling

Terminology:
Life = Process that can retain its complexity and replicate
Life 1.0 = Life that evolves its hardware and software (biological stage)
Life 2.0 = Life that evolves its hardware but designs much of its software (cultural stage)
Life 3.0 = Life that designs its hardware and software (technological stage)
Intelligence = Ability to accomplish complex goals
Artificial Intelligence (AI) = Non-biological intelligence
Narrow intelligence = Ability to accomplish a narrow set of goals, e.g., play chess or drive a car
General intelligence = Ability to accomplish virtually any goal, including learning
Universal intelligence = Ability to acquire general intelligence given access to data and resources
[Human-level] Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) = Ability to accomplish any cognitive task at least as well as humans
Human-level AI = AGI
Strong AI = AGI
Superintelligence = General intelligence far beyond human level
Civilization = Interacting group of intelligent life forms
Consciousness = Subjective experience
Qualia = Individual instances of subjective experience
Ethics = Principles that govern how we should behave
Teleology = Explanation of things in terms of their goals or purposes rather than their causes
Goal-oriented behavior = Behavior more easily explained via its effect than via its cause
Having a goal = Exhibiting goal-oriented behavior
Having purpose = Serving goals of one's own or of another entity
Friendly AI = Superintelligence whose goals are aligned with ours
Cyborg = Human-machine hybrid
Intelligence explosion = Recursive self-improvement rapidly leading to superintelligence
Singularity = Intelligence explosion
Universe = The region of space from which light has had time to reach us during the 13.8 billion years since our Big Bang
(Many misunderstandings about AI are caused by people using the words above to mean different things.)

Intelligence is ultimately all about information and computation, not about flesh, blood or carbon atoms.
- THIS ISN'T TRUE, SINCE HUMAN EXISTENCE IS MORE ORGANIC, AND OUR LOGIC IS BUILT UPON EMOTIONS

Industrial accidents have decreased rather than increased as technology has improved, dropping from about 14,000 deaths in 1970 to 4,821 in 2014.

- HOWEVER, THIS IS THE STANDARD FOR TECH DEMOS: THEY TAKE FOREVER TO IMPLEMENT COMPARED TO EXPECTATION, IF THEY EVER TAKE OFF
