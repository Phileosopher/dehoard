PRINCIPLE THAT MAY GO TO SECURITY OR CYSEC, MAYBE GIS
- One way to protect against invasion is to have multiple barriers, with degrees of safety for each
- e.g., subsidiary corporations that can get sued without the parent company being affected
- e.g., city walls in layers toward the government center
- e.g., multiple firewalls with different encryptions each layer

if you're particularly paranoid, make sure to change your devices' MAC address, since that MAC has the origination and likely information about the firmware on it

Have a burner browser
- Even if you use privacy-minded things in a browser (e.g. private windows, no cookies), some services detect this.
- For this reason, have a "burner" browser that has absolutely nothing in it
- Preferably, it should use a different framework (e.g., Firefox uses Gecko, so use Chromium w/ Brave)

Identity theft protection
- On average, it takes 800 hours to resolve identity fraud.
    - Good protection services will assign a counselor to clean up the mess.
- Don't get ID theft protection that only monitors credit reports.
    - Several popular services like [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com/) will monitor credit for free.
- identity theft insurance can often be part of the ID theft protection package - https://www.cnbc.com/select/id-theft-insurance/

With peer-to-peer payments (P2P), you can transfer money to someone from your bank account, debit card, or credit card using a website or mobile app such as Zelle, Cash App, PayPal, or Venmo. P2P payments can also include your financial institution's apps, such as Schwab Mobile. While P2P payments are popular and convenient, understanding the risks can help you avoid becoming a victim of scams and fraud.

How do scams and fraud differ?
Fraud involves someone accessing your account without your permission and completing unauthorized transactions. A scam involves being tricked into authorizing a transaction or sending a payment. It's important to remember the difference, as the same protections do not always apply to both.

In general, be VERY vigilant about the information you enter, and consider how it makes any sense to get used
Do NOT enter your credit card info into something just because they need to "verify your age"
You don't need to "make a login" for a public site like wikipedia
those logins will often ask for extra information, much of which you shouldn't give away freely

The reason this is a big issue, EVEN IF THE COMPANY IS LEGITIMATE, is because your personal information is as safe as that company's server is safe from getting hacked
i.e., it can happen to anyone who wasn't paying attention to 1 setting in a computer somewhere and 1 teenage/incel found it

FROM NORDVPN TEST
- Wifi:
    - secure password
    - disable SSID on router
    - WPA2/WPA3 encryption
    - enable MAC address filtering on router
- Password security???
- Malware causes:
    - opening random downloaded files
    - clicking on unknown links
    - visiting suspicious sites
    - opening emails from unknown sources
- IoT problems
    - no encryption
    - no-password access
    - no standards/regulation on many things
    - discreet audio/video recording

What information could do
- With your passport number, someone could:
    - Book an international flight as you
    - Apply for anything that requires proof of identity documentation with the government, e.g. Working with children check
    - Activate a SIM card (and so get an internet connection that's traceable to you, not them, hiding them from the government)
    - Create a fake physical passport from a template, with the correct passport number (which they then use to cross a border, open a bank account, or anything)
- with a password, soemoene could
- login to that particular computer (if 2FA wasn't enabled
- login to ANY other site that had the same password/email combo

CySec hardening concepts
- Disable/remove Native VLAN
- Check for redirects and diversions
    - #62* redirect
    - _#21# diversions_
    - _##002# remove redirections_
- _Packet analyzer for phones_
    - _##197328640#_#
    - UMTS RR Information (cell ID#)
    - MM Info > Serving PLMN (area code)
    - Netmonitor website (OpenCellID, e.g.)
- Record all relevant information
    - IMEIs of all devices #06#

We can apply obfuscation in our own lives by using practices and technologies that make use of it, including:
- The secure browser Tor, which (among other anti-surveillance technologies) muddles our Internet activity with that of other Tor users, concealing our trail in that of many others.
- The browser plugins TrackMeNot and AdNauseam, which explore obfuscation techniques by issuing many fake search requests and loading and clicking every ad, respectively.
- The browser extension Go Rando, which randomly chooses your emotional "reactions" on Facebook, interfering with their emotional profiling and analysis.
- Playful experiments like Adam Harvey's "HyperFace" project, finding patterns on textiles that fool facial recognition systems - not by hiding your face, but by creating the illusion of many faces.

Web content is frequently insecure because it's often a hybrid of secure AND insecure elements
- this is especially egregious with web forms, which can send insecure content EVEN WHEN IT'S A HTTPS SITE!
