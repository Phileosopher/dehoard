Tips to protect yourself:

- Deny requests for a password. We'll never call you and ask for your Ally account password to verify your account. These scammers will.
- Ask questions. Asking questions like "When's the last time I called you?" may prompt the fraudster to hang up.
- Call us directly and [report fraud](https://click.alerts.ally.com/?qs=5af77452725c4636ed5637135eac1d6f130c488e054159f0689ec0c6573b837b1e6d26b2478ced8907c8136ec8a422dfc0e711f26d2745dc).
