Ways to protect yourself from payment fraud:
- Pay it safe: Since most P2P apps don't allow you to cancel a transaction, treat payments like cash, and only send funds to those you know and trust.
- Take your time: If someone is pushing you to act quickly with a P2P payment, it could be a red flag.
- Use your security settings: Enable settings within the P2P applications, such as multifactor authentication (also known as two-factor authentication),
- Let your financial institution help: Fraud alerts can automatically notify you of activity, and always contact your financial institution immediately if you suspect something is wrong.
- Be aware of phishing: Fraudsters might try to access your account by posing as your financial institution or a P2P company. If someone calls you unexpectedly and claims to be from your financial institution, it is best to hang up and call your financial institution at the number printed on your statement rather than the number that called you.
- Use unique passwords: Use different passwords for P2P apps and other sites, avoid sharing your passwords with others, and consider a password manager tool if you have trouble remembering passwords.

FROM CHARLES SCHWAB
- Stay vigilant. You can help prevent fraud with these simple steps:
    - Hover over links in an email to confirm they are from legitimate sources before clicking on them and do not dial the number in an email or pop-up alert.
    - Ensure your computer systems, online browsers, and mobile devices are updated with the latest versions of software.
    - Establish unique and strong login credentials. At Schwab, you can create a password or passphrase. Be sure to create a password that you use only with Schwab and nowhere else.
    - Change your password periodically to ensure your security if you have not changed your password for a long period.
    - Use two-step verification, which will provide you a unique security code each time you access your accounts. Visit the Security Center tab to update your two-step verification settings.
    - Review your existing passwords and ensure they are updated to strong and unique passwords if they have not been updated or changed for a long period of time.
    - Manage your alert settings through [Schwab.com](http://schwab.com/) or the Schwab mobile app. When possible, enable "Push" notifications for real-time activity alerts.



Here are seven tips to know you’re working with Schwab:
	
Look out for unsolicited offers.

We’ll never contact you directly using a messaging app (like Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp) to offer unsolicited investment opportunities.
	
Check before giving remote access to your computer.

Before giving someone remote access, especially if they proactively contact you saying there's an issue or suspected fraud, call the phone number listed below or on Schwab's public site to verify you’re speaking with Schwab.
	
Avoid clicking suspicious links.

Don’t click on links sent through social media or text unless you’re confident they’re real, especially if they promise lucrative investment opportunities.
	
Use caution with “special” opportunities.

Be wary of investment opportunities based on alleged “insider” or confidential information, as these could involve illegal or fraudulent activities.
	
Beware of urgency and pressure tactics.

Be cautious of communications urging immediate action or pressuring you to invest quickly with promises of guaranteed or unusually high returns. Remember: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
	
Do your research and verify.

Before committing to anything, call us at the number below or through one of our official channels first to verify the legitimacy of the information and the individuals involved.
	
Stick to our official channels.

Always use our verified, secure communication channels for all transactions and inquiries. These can be found at schwab.com/contactus.
