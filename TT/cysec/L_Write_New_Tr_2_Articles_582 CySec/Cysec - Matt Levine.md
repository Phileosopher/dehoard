The internet [tells me](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/15/politics/classified-information-what-matters/index.html) that there are about 1.2 million people in the US with top secret security clearance. You could imagine a sort of cool spy-movie world in which "top secret" secrets were really top secret and only shared with a few, carefully vetted, highly trustworthy people. But at 1.2 million people, nah. At 1.2 million people, even if your vetting process is 99.99% reliable, you will still have 120 people who forget their top secret documents on the train, or leave their top secret laptops open at the coffee shop while they go to the bathroom, or have loud top secret phone conversations in public places, or are actual spies for the other side. At 1.2 million people, no matter how good your vetting is, the far left tail of the trustworthiness distribution is going to be [this guy](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/air-force-employee-indicted-unlawful-disclosure-classified-national-defense-information):

> A civilian employee of the U.S. Air Force assigned to the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), at Offutt Air Force Base, was arrested Saturday, March 2, for allegedly conspiring to transmit and transmitting classified information relating to the national defense (National Defense Information or NDI) on a foreign online dating platform beginning in or around February 2022 until in or around April 2022.
> 
> According to the indictment, David Franklin Slater, 63, of Nebraska, worked in a classified space at USSTRATCOM and held a Top Secret security clearance from in or around August 2021 until in or around April 2022, after retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel from the U.S. Army. It is alleged that Slater willfully, improperly, and unlawfully transmitted NDI classified as "SECRET," which he had reason to believe could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation, on a foreign online dating platform to a person not authorized to receive such information.

Yes, somewhere out there, there will inevitably be a guy who (1) has a top secret security clearance and (2) will hand out military secrets to impress obviously fake partners on an online dating site. Allegedly Slater got classified briefings about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and he had a fake online girlfriend "who claimed to be a female living in Ukraine on the foreign dating website." From [the indictment](https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1340961/dl?inline):

> Co-Conspirator 1 [the fake girlfriend] regularly asked DAVID FRANKLIN SLATER to provide her with sensitive, non-public, closely held, and classified NDI, to which DAVID FRANKLIN SLATER had access as a result of his employment with the United States Air Force. For example, Co-Conspirator 1 stated in 2022: …
> 
> On or about March 11, "Dear, what is shown on the screens in the special room?? It is very interesting." …
> 
> On or about March 15, … "You are my secret informant love! How were your meetings? Successfully?"
> 
> On or about March 18, "Beloved Dave, do NATO and Biden have a secret plan to help us?" ...
> 
> On or about April 12, "Sweet Dave, the supply of weapons is completely classified, which is great!"

Did he ever worry that maybe she only loved him for his top secret information and not for his sparkling personality? Did he care? How could this possibly have worked? Well, it only had to work on one guy.
