Protect Your Bank Accounts from Fraud: Tips to Stay Secure
At Bask Bank we understand the importance of safeguarding your personal information and financial security. With the rise of phishing scams and schemes, it's more important than ever to be aware of online threats this holiday season. Follow these tips to keep your information secure and learn what to do if you see suspicious activity on your account.

What you can do:

    Monitor your bank account transactions and security alerts in Online Banking. Bask Bank will notify you when account changes are made or requested.
    Avoid using a public Wi-Fi network to log in to websites or mobile apps that requires a username or password. Unsecure networks can put your personal and banking information at risk.
    Keep your personal financial information private. Never share your bank account or credit card details to anyone offering you prizes or gifts or in response to an unsolicited request.
    Never send money or gifts to anyone you haven't met in person. Be aware of anyone online asking you to send giftcards, wire funds, or send money through a mobile payment app.
    Be wary of emails, text messages or phone calls claiming to be a reputable company urging you to act immediately or asking you to verify your personal or financial information. Don't click links in suspicious emails or text messages and remember, Bask Bank will never ask you for your Online Banking password.
