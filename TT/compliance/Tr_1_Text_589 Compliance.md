## Protection

MAKE SURE TO CONSIDER [INSURANCE]

it's worth noting the security/efficiency tradeoff

- a cysec policy that's too constricting will prevent people from ever getting work done (e.g., can't even view a powerpoint file from a flash drive and can't send it via email)

- The comments indicate it well:
- Your mission isn't to safeguard assets. Your mission is to help bring cyber risk in line with company policy. If you advise X, Y and Z because A and they say no because B, you document it and go get a Coke.
- There's something very wrong about corporate awfulness, and that's cysec for you.
