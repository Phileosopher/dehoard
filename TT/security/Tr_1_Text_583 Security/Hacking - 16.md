A lot of the domain of hacking is tied to violations of privacy

- in some capacity, there's a belief that only "authorized" people can go into something (which usually is the case, barring [big companies]FAANG) interfering)
- hacking is the intervention of someone finding a way to get around those constraints
    - this is ALWAYS possible, since the computer is nothing more than logic/math machine: match the logic/math, the computer thinks you're legit when you're not
    - the only way to NOT permit this is to have a human being reviewing everything, but [AI] is the dumb fashion of the day to fix the problem

MAKE SURE TO TALK ABOUT THE "DARK WEB"

To programmers, "hacker" connotes mastery in the most literal sense:
someone who can make a computer do what he wants.

The noun "hack" also has two senses. It can be either a compliment or an
insult. It's called a hack when you do something in an ugly way. But
when you do something so clever that you somehow beat the system, that's
also called a hack.

- sometimes the hackers actually PRESERVE the integrity of the original games (see comments)
- cracked media are often the only way to preserve things that DRM might permanently lock down

### From old blog post

FROM MY OLD "TO MY FRIENDS" PAGE:

Focus your lives on things beyond this life. That aforementioned De1ty will come back and rule with strength and love. Focus on building that society, since the time is utterly short.

Change your language, both writing and speaking. Read Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four to understand the scope of control that people have, especially with computers. It also helps to be aware of what computers can and can't do. My writing here is an example of something that will likely stay below the radar for now, but pleaseâ€¦get creative!

Share organically. In-person engagement is how the early People of the De{ty interacted and grew. Ancient Rome feel before the People did, mostly because the ideas of the Book were more powerful than the meat part of us.

Get ready to travel. I don't mean that you must give everything up now, but be prepared to travel light, and fast. Trust the Great Pneuma who guides those that are loved by him.

Always pr@y. Give everything you can't presently control to that Being. He cares tremendously, and will protect you to accomplish the purpose you've been chosen for.

Clear history whenever possible. This includes web history, computer records, social profiles. Minimize what you can. Take things offline.

Decentralize whenever possible. Stay away from meeting in large groups. Use self-hosted websites and email over mainstream stuff. Distrust anything with computers that is "free" unless it's open-source. Stay at home for your interactions, even if you invite a few dozen people. Get creative on how.
