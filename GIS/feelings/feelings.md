
emotions are lenses upon reality
- long-term emotions create warped lenses (e.g., sadness becomes depression)

the anxiety and fear creates a chaotic element
- Jordan Peterson: a hole with snakes coming out of it

the best answer is to move up the chain to the place where the emotions begin
- I'll call this the "origination point"

the emotions back themselves up to certain events that create beliefs, represented as emotions
- anxiety is a fearful state, which creates endless potential catastrophes
- bitterness is an angry state, which acts in constant "assault" against everything
- depression is a sad state, which tears down all meaning and purpose
- shame is a self-inflicted "status" in society of being a bad or destructive thing
each has its own cures:
- if i'm afraid, I must preoccupy with death
- if I'm bitter, I must abdicate responsibility for everything beyond my control
- if I'm depressed, I must push forward into a good purpose
- if I'm ashamed, I must identify as a valuable individual

so, in my situation:
- i'm afraid of losing Tori and the kids
- i'm bitter about this conflict escalation
- i'm depressed when I stop, for any reason
- i'm ashamed that I've lost my temper, and that i'm an ex-con

in identity: we are not our feelings, we are not our thoughts
- we are the soul that oversees those feelings and thoughts

per Jules: the feelings simply need to fly by
