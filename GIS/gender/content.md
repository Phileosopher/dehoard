
women are wired to take care of babies, and that makes them extremely kind and patient with the failings of the object in question
- this is vital to life, otherwise babies would be neglected and die
- the issue is that it's the wrong time and place in many other contexts, and stops being [effective](purpose) after 6 months
- when they haven't been programmed out of it, they will continue with that infant-based mindset and treat EVERYTHING of value like a 6-month-old
- the [political](power-types) result of this (i.e., women in power) is to create an anti-predator mindset, which effectively gives ZERO [justice] to that claimed "predator" (e.g., [political violence](war) within [leftism])

marriage devolves in stages:
1. First, they will coexist well-enough, with routine encounters with each other that involve the elements of surprise and fascination. The two will be in a state of "play", both of them in a dynamic that explores each other.
2. After the flames of passion die off, the two of them will transition into a dull routine. That routine, specifically in its lack of both people changing as they experience each other, is the first warning sign, and the presence of other people in the community in their lives can kickstart that routine again by providing new ways to see each other. It may have happened if my father lived with us eight months ago.
3. For any variety of reasons, the female will fail to create a meaningful connection with the male, and in an attempt to maintain it will trade out her "feminine" qualities (i.e., connection, nurture, holistic thinking, sentiment) for "masculine" ones (i.e., strength, assertion, directness). Since women are not disposed to those qualities, it will implement as something else entirely. This may involve criticizing, condemning, or complaining.
  - In the process, she may devote her heart to another male figure who demonstrates those qualities. More often than not, the new male figure is less familiar to her, meaning they're starting into Step 1 together, and she doesn't realize this will repeat itself eventually.
4. The natural male response will be to treat their not-male-but-behaving-like-a-male female as a male. If he does, the dominance hierarchy will come into force, and it will yield increasingly worse results. This is what happened in my marriage.
5. However, if that male does not respond to the dominance signal with more dominance, the female will have to eventually perform some form of self-reflection on her actions. She will have to decide on revisiting her femininity for the sake of the relationship (which is an inherent risk) or keep doing what she's doing and risk destroying the relationship further. It gets harder for her to change the longer she persists in that state.
In effect, most marriages are in various states of decline. A marriage-ending altercation is always brewing, waiting for someone to snap, and the only cure is through the steady and consistent regeneration of both people to become better versions of themselves. My opinion is that it's through Christ alone to find those tools, but that's more a discussion of how than of what.

MUCH OF OUR GENDER IDENTITY IS IN THE FORMATIVE UTILITY AS WE EXPLORE OUR INFANT BODY AS A SOUL
- MEN ARE RUDIMENTARY, AND ONLY ALIGN TO [PURPOSE]
- WOMEN HAVE A REPRODUCTION MECHANISM THAT CREATES A [SAFETY] MODEL, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY WIRED AROUND 2 THINGS AT ONCE
