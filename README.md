# dehoard

I have been hoarding information. I justified this by making websites and assuming it would add value to someone, somewhere.

That vision is now destroyed, and I have lots of information to say goodbye to.

They go to several places:

1. [stucky.tech/notes](https://stucky.tech/notes)
2. [toolbox](https://github.com/Phileosopher/toolbox)
3. deleted outright

This is what's left.
