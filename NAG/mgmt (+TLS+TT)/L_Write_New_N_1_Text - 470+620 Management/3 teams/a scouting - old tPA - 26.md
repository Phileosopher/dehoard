
### Search for candidates correctly

Everyone promises they can do the job, but you need specific skills more than likability or general aptitude

#### Look for the BEST personality for your role

Personality determines fit from preferences, not aptitude
A. Each person focuses more on tasks or other people
B. Each person prefers to make their decisions slowly or quickly
- Mentally well people take on roles of their less dominant styles as they mature
- Mentally unhealthy people intensify their adverse behaviors over time
- Take on the diametrically opposite role during the interview to see the candidate more objectively

Boss (task-focused, quick decisions)
- Dominant, driven, and confident
- Risks behaving insensitively to others

Engager (people-focused, quick decisions)
- Persuasive, convincing, and closes deals
- However, can put pressure on others

Supporter (people-focused, slow decisions)
- Collaborative, understanding, and counsels others
- Can be bureaucratic and slow

Technical (task-focused, slow decisions)
- Analytical, insightful, and deliberative
- Can be overcontrolling

Avoid building a homogenous mix of personalities in your team
- Teams with only planners talk much and do little
- Teams with only performers take many unnecessary risks
- Task-based teams invalidate the human element in the team and outside the group
- People-based teams become a progressively more disorganized and unproductive mess

#### Start looking for workers before you need them

It always takes longer to find good workers than it seems
- Recruit or think of new ways to recruit every single day
- You may not think you need them now, but great talent ready to work is an insurance policy
- Consulting a list of great options is better than feeling pressured to make a quick decision

Use appropriate social media networks and software
- If you find an applicant you love, gain their trust by impressing their family
- Weed out poor fits for the position with applicant-tracking software

### Advertise correctly

A worker will only transfer if they feel they're receiving at least a 30% non-monetary increase
- Their change includes new skills learned, job growth, and a better mix of more satisfying work
- The less someone feels others appreciate their work, the more you'll need to pay

Make the job advertisement interesting, exciting, and in the first-person
- A job advertisement which sounds boring deters talented workers
- Attract more talent with witty and entertaining [writing](https://philosaccounting.com/a/writing-basics/)

#### Avoid a tedious or robotic applicant tracking system

- Your hiring process should honor the qualifications and time of experts
- Don't penalize blank spaces or require too many text boxes for them to enter information

Stay in fluid and natural communication with all applicants
- Robotic communication implies a robotic company policy
- Give every applicant an interview rejection or approval if the application has a deadline

### Always build your team

Attracting, developing, and keeping top-level talent is a manager's perpetual job
- Unless the team breaks up in fewer than six months, keep looking for more relevant talent
- Top talent takes time to discover from constant searching

Look for significant cultural gaps as the group expands and for qualified people to fit those roles
- The team member has to have proven their ability to match the role
- New team members must mesh with the rest of the team

Look for creative ways to recruit
- Competitions, job fairs, and internships
- Try temporary-to-hire positions
- Give work opportunities through extracurricular activities

Temps dilute the culture, especially when they're the leadership
Keep it max 40-50%, since any more will dilute the culture from lack of loyalty

On a contract/project, employees who are paid hourly ALWAYS have the perverse incentive to work slower unless they believe they can have steady work long-term
- The unethical way to keep them working diligently is to promise more steady employment
- the ethical way is to simply stay on top of them and crack the whip, or to provide very clear boundaries about what you want done and not expect anything more of them
- the AWESOME manager way is to either give direct financial bonuses for additional work done, or to give them time off for better work (e.g., a full day's pay for a half-day of double work)

When checking references for a job applicant, employers may be reluctant or prohibited from saying anything negative, so leave or send a message that says, "Get back to me if you highly recommend this applicant as super great." If they don't reply take that as a negative.
You cannot get smart people to work extremely hard just for money.
You can be whatever you want, so be the person who ends meetings early.
When you lead, your real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.
Immediately pay what you owe to vendors, workers, contractors. They will go out of their way to work with you first next time.

Experience is overrated. When hiring, hire for aptitude, train for skills. Most really amazing or great things are done by people doing them for the first time.
