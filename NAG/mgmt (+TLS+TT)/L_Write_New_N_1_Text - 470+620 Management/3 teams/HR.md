If you are good with people and enjoy helping them resolve conflicts and issues, you might consider becoming an HR specialist. HR stands for Human Resources.

Human resources management is recruiting talents and developing a solid company's workforce. The HR department identifies skills or human resources in a company, evaluates potential candidates, and hires talent. They are also in charge of advertising a position for a company.

An HR specialist screens, recruits, interviews, and places new employees.

Other HR responsibilities include:
- Handling employee relations
- Handling payroll
- Managing benefits and training for employees
- Consulting with executives on strategic planning

HR is there to serve the COMPANY'S interests
- since a manager is generally harder to replace and often paid more, HR will usually protect the manager over the employee
- however, once a manager becomes too large a risk (or redundant), they'll be there to get rid of that manager
- stay upfront with your charges about this fact, and everyone will respect you more
