Talent on demand rather than having to pay for employees all the time, whether you need them or not.

You are hiring an independent contractor who is an expert at what they do (rather than a jack of all trades).

Virtual Support Organizations (VSO) provide ongoing support like an employee, but from a distance.

Financial management : use online accounting systems (quickbooks.com) so a virtual CFO can remotely manage and keep me up-to-date on every aspect of my company's financial health.

Do not make the mistake of dumping more and broader scope of work on them, as time goes on.

DO
- value the relationship
- see your VA as an equal partner
- articulate your needs and wants well
- maintain a trusting relationship
- stay centered, focused, and organized so as not to distract your VA

DON'T
- fail to communicate when they request something from you
- attempt to micromanage
- treat your VA like a low-level employee
- live in the urgent, where everything is last-minute

Important to have a written business process for each support function a VA does for you. This discipline will quickly disappear into a mist of good intentions as soon as you try to broaden the scope of your VAs.

COO : Must have extensive experience assisting businesses from the strategic, operational, and HR perspectives.

Start with the small steps of hiring VAs for specific, measurable tasks. After you have two or more working with you and everything is going smoothly, consider hiring an executive level VA to grow your virtual team beyond that point.

If your VA team interacts with your prospects, customers, or suppliers, have them use your email signature (with their name not yours).
