
#### Conventional interviewing techniques are flawed

The interview is both seen as standard practice and the fastest way to gauge performance
- However, a 30-minute interview doesn't measure much
- A conventional interview only assesses a candidate's ability to convince others
- Technical interviews focus on a given task without looking at cultural fit

An interview can undercut relevant information
- In college recruiting, interviewers skew against students with lower GPA's who may have more qualifications
- A candidate's lies are almost always impossible to discern since [there's no social context to pull from](https://philosaccounting.com/a/dissecting-pinocchio-christopher-dillingham-m-a/)

Create alternative ways to interview well
- Only ask practical questions
    - Discover more about them by asking them what they've been recently reading
- Give them homework and interview them based on their performance
    - The homework could be an unimportant task for the organization
- Instead of giving an interview, have them interview you instead to gauge their ability to think
- Give internships or 30-day no-obligation trial periods to find viable technical workers
- Finding competent workers on the job market is often more difficult than grooming interns into great workers
- If you can afford it, give a skills test battery with a 30-day trial period
- Interviewing well is a skill of trial-and-error

#### Look for the correct traits in a candidate

A candidate is a good hire if you see several universal traits
- Adaptable to spontaneous or unplanned situations without losing their nerve
- Open to new ideas and experiences
- Honest about their skills, limitations, and capabilities
    - Don't hire them if they distrust you in the interview or are somehow withholding
- Resourceful and steadily improving in long-term learning outside formal education
- Self-disciplined and desires to create work others will use
- Desires to grow with clear career goals unrelated to titles or status
    - A career goal for a title or the ability to direct others is a negative trait
- Rationally and openly admits graciously when they're wrong, even when only slightly
- Team-oriented and focused on the organization's collective growth
    - Watch if they brag about proudly defending something or gaining ground
- Since you're hiring them for competence in something you may not know, they should be smarter than you

Some circumstances need specific traits, so ignore capability and look for fit on the following
- Being sociable is risky in an environment with little human connection
- Analytical tendencies are risky when you want enthusiasm and energy
- Ambitiousness can harm a complex process-oriented system
- Team players often hate working alone
- Perfectionists are often dangerous when results demand speed or adaptation
- Young people are more ambitious and reckless, while older people are more skilled and jaded

Reject a candidate, no matter what, for any job position on the following
- Unintelligent or entirely unwilling to learn new things
- A depressing or miserable personality
- Tends to use hyperbole, extremism or overly emotional reactions
- So overconfident in their abilities they can't accept mistakes
- A poor personality mix for the position

### Value their time and yours in interviews

Use software like [InterviewStream](https://interviewstream.com) for long-distance communication
Avoid conventional phrases which don't make sense
- "We're the best at what we do" - vague and sets an impossible expectation
- "We are experts" - implies everyone in the organization is an expert
- "We've been doing this for X years" - implies an unchanging culture
- "We have a tough interview process" - not necessarily true for [talented interviewers](https://philosaccounting.com/a/get-a-job/)
- "We don't post jobs; we run off of recommendations" - implies an inbred culture of friend-coworkers

Asking a patronizing, irrelevant or stupid question will usually lead a true [professional](https://philosaccounting.com/a/level-1-being-a-professional/) to believe their time is worth more than yours

#### Try to discern between a great interviewer and a great candidate

Gut instincts are great for business decisions but awful for choosing candidates
- If you doubt whether someone can do the task, look for specific reasons you have your doubts
- Even if you're rushing to fill a position, never emphasize skills and experience more than performance, attitude, and fit

Ask direct and pointed questions instead of vague or general ones
Use a sales pitch for the position, then watch their reaction to understand how they'd fit into the culture
Have multiple members of the team meet or interview the candidate

#### Pick the right questions for what you want to learn

Don't ask questions which don't reflect their ability to do the job
- The presence of any notable employers, impressive educational credentials, GPAs or any external commendations
- Scores on personality tests, at least outside the job description's needs
    - If you're interviewing correctly, you should have weeded them out from the interview already
    - However, personality results can help determine if they're lying or self-unaware
- Past or present salary, which only measures their ability to negotiate
- Age, family or any other demographics
- Gaps in employment, though you should know why they left their last job
- Tasks and duties from past jobs don't matter, only whether they can perform the current one
    - "Progressively more responsible positions" don't matter either

"What is your greatest accomplishment?"
- The best question you can ask
    - Shows what they value most
    - Removes any uncertainties about what they can accomplish
    - By connecting to their passion, you can see how they work when they're happy
- Ask for details
    - When did it happen and how long did it take?
    - What results did you achieve?
    - What was the organization, role, title, position, and team?
    - What parts of the project did you enjoy or dislike?
    - How did this accomplishment change and grow you?
    - What types of formal recognition did you receive from it?
    - If you could do it again, what would you do differently?

"What can I expect from you in the first 100 days on the job?"
- Shows how they think and their long-term plans

"What does it mean to you to be on a team?"
- A team is both being helping and getting help

"Don't use names, but can you tell me about your best and worst boss?"
- Shows how much personal responsibility they take
- Shows what they prefer and hate in a work environment
- Shows if they're loving and understanding or mean and spiteful

"How many pennies does it take to fill a room?"
- Shows their problem-solving ability
- Shows their preference for details and specificity
- Make your own to have more fun or find specific problem-solving skills

"Tell me about yourself."
- A common question every job candidate should be ready to answer
- Shows how well they think through their experiences

"What can you do to bring our organization to the next level?"
- Gives you potentially great ideas and whether the candidate has a vision for the future

"Describe a situation where you had to manage multiple things in your personal or work life. How did you deal with it?"
- Shows their ability to handle stress and intense work environments

"What have you done to improve yourself in the last two years?"
- Shows their desire to grow personally, professionally or spiritually

"What is your life's mission statement?"
- Makes the candidate think and shows how they process the question
- Shows what they believe their purpose to be and its connection to their work style

"What can you tell me about our organization?"
- Shows how much the candidate cares about the job opportunity

Offer a position for a somewhat related and more prestigious role on the team
- If they jump at it, they don't want the job they're interviewing for

#### Many candidates use the same lies

Education lies
- "I have all the credits; I just didn't graduate."
- "I've done all the classes; I just need to pay the fees to graduate."
- "I graduated from (university), but it was a long time ago. I'm not sure why they can't verify my degree."
- "I had a 3.0 GPA in my 'core' classes, but a 1.9 GPA overall."
- "It was actually an (actual major) and business degree."

Background check lies
- "No, I'm not on drugs (fails drug check) Oh, you meant marijuana as a drug."
- "She told me she was 18."
- "They told me in court it would never be on my file, so I didn't think I needed to tell you."
- "No, I don't have a felony (finds felony) Oh, that felony! That was in a different district."
Experience lies
- "When you said Java, I thought you meant experience making coffee."
- "I was part of the leadership team responsible for implementing it."

Not showing up to the interview
- "My car broke down."
- "I couldn't find your location."
- "My child was sick."

Termination lies
- "It was a mutual decision for me to leave."
- "I (or family member) was in a bad accident and went to the hospital, so they fired me for not showing up to work."
- "I volunteer at a community event, and we have drinks afterward. The next morning my boss smelled alcohol and fired me for drinking on the job."

### Research and connect after meeting with the candidate

Followup outside of what they told you
- Contact references who may know the candidate but weren't on the reference list
- Search the internet for them, personally and professionally

Observe their influence and network to create future hiring opportunities
- Even if that person has no value to you, their network does
