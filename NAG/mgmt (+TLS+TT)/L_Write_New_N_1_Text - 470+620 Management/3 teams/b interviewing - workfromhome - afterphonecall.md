Do you have any suggestions for completing what we need done in a more effective manner than the way it was described?

Are you anticipating any initial setup before you can start? If so, what will it entail and how much will it cost?

Why do you require a retainer? What happpens to the unused balance at the end of each month?

Why are you excited about taking on my company as a client?

What is the range of hours during the day I can contact you?

Are there any restrictions as to when or how I can contact you in the event of an emergency?

How often do you invoice and what "net" terms do you typically require?

Do you have any concerns or objections if we use my own Indepdent Contractor's Agreement for our working relationship?

How soon can you start?
