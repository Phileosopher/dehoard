
Digging deeper - asking the candidate's references for other references,

Call references at what you assume will be their lunchtime - you want to reach an assistant or voice mail.

Jones is a candidate for (the position) in our company. Your name has been given as a reference. Please call me back if the candidate was outstanding."

If the candidate is outstanding or excellent, I guarantee that eight out of ten people will respond quickly and want to help. Take such a response as a green light.

If only two or three of the ten references selected by the candidate return your call, this message is also loud and clear. And yet: No derogatory information has been shared. No libelous statements have been made. No confidences or laws have been broken.

For all references, the higher you go up an organization, the more likely you are to get helpful information.

Tap the enormous wealth of publicly available data banks that may contain information on a candidate's driving and financial records, real estate dealings, court appearances, and litigation history. Perfectly legal, this is all public information and is readily available.

Always ask the candidate, "What am I likely to hear - positive and negative - when I call your references?"

Candidates always deserve the courtesy of explaining the peaks and valleys of their work history.

Call and ask about:
1. Technical Competence Can the candidate perform the required tasks? Can the university president raise money? Can the secretary spell? Can the receptionist handle phones? These are easy pitches, and references should be able to hit the ball out of the park.
2. Intelligence This topic can take a few seconds to consider. "On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate the candidate's intelligence?" Most references respond well to a ten-point scale for rating people.
3. People Skills Ask about the candidate's interpersonal skills. How does she get along with bosses? What about subordinates and peers? You'll usually get a ringing endorsement, but listen for silences, gaps, and omissions in this part of the conversation.
4. Motivation What motivates the candidate? Financial rewards? Meaningful assignments? A job well done? Pats on the back? Independence? All of the above? I have seen candidates decline offers because of relationships ("My fiance just accepted an offer in Salt Lake"), money ("My company just beat your offer"), and educational concerns ("My daughter's special school needs aren't available in your city"). How you structure your offer depends upon a person's motivations and your understanding of these motivations.
5. Everything Else Finally you should say, "Is there anything that I haven't asked?" Then listen carefully.

Here's a second format for phone references:
•  Did you like the person?
•  What did they fail at doing?
•  Reputation in the company?
•  How did they communicate?
•  Reputation in the industry?
•  How did they react to authority?
•  Reason for leaving?
•  Level of energy, drive?
•  What did they accomplish?
•  What would you change about the person if you could?
