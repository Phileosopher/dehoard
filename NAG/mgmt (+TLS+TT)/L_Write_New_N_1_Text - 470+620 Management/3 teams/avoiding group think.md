
Team dysfunction often derives from group-think
- Group-think is the tendency to not think individually and personally on apparent issues and challenges which face the group
1. Members misjudge their standards as higher than reality and that they can't fail
2. They rationalize everything to discredit legitimate warnings or negative feedback
3. Everyone pressures each other to stay quiet about any complaints or negative consequences

Group-think creates many negative results
• Higher peer pressure against positive changes
• State of complacency about group tasks
• Highly censored opinions everyone publicly conforms to
• Illusions about unanimous agreement on a decision
