Producers are proportional instruments, but managers are exponential instruments

Negativity is a cancer. Never hire negative people and fire them asap

You need respect and loyalty

Bill Gates has said that if you took the twenty smartest people out of
Microsoft it would be an insignificant company, and if you ask around
the company what its core competency is, they don't say anything about
software. They say it's hiring.

IQ is a decent predictor of performance on an unfamiliar task, but once
a person has been at a job for a few years, IQ predicts little or
nothing about performance.

General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt has been clear about what the company
is looking for: someone who is externally focused, is a clear thinker,
has imagination, is an inclusive leader, and is a confident expert.
Those are behaviors, not traits.

Choosing human capital:
1. Never choose an important employee or a key supplier alone. Get others to interview them or talk to them as well, either with you or separately. The final choice must be yours alone.
2. Go further than reading a person's references. It's such a pain, but it pays. Make an appointment with their last company or with a supplier's other customers. Go and see someone there. Get chatty. Listen hard. You will discover more about the person or supplier in a few minutes in this way than in hours of conversation with them.
3. Make notes. Speak little. Have a series of questions ready to shoot out when they grind to a halt. Focus like mad on what your instict is telling you. You are being interviewed, too, so best to keep your mouth shut.
4. Good suppliers respect attention to detail.
5. Pay employees well. Bonuses better.
6. Ignore your prejudices.
7. Don't leave senior employees in any job too long. You will get the most out of any senior employee in their first year or two in a new position. After that, they enter a comfort zone.

Never stop looking for talent and promoting talent.

Hiring someone who is the breadwinner of in a single-income family is a double-edged sword
- their family means they will likely never quit on the fly
- at the same time, they will NOT be 100% devoted to the company (e.g., overtime) unless they become [addicted] to their work (which is unethical to outright foster)

Make sure to hire people more talented and stronger than you.
- Those people will [specialize] in things you can't, and will see things you don't see
- the smartest people are the most [creative] and efficient at what they do, and are often able to [lead] profoundly well
- This requires great [leadership] skills, which requires the right [personality] and the right [social skills]

Intuition is only accurate in domains where it has been carefully
trained. If you're a chess grand master, you should trust your gut. If
you're a manager making a hiring decision, you shouldn't. (You've
probably hired only a small number of people over the years, and the
feedback from those hires is delayed and often confounded by other factors.)
- hiring is a headache, so it really does make sense to hire from people you know personally, since you have experience around them to know if they'd fit into your organization

If you assemble a team from contract workers, expect ZERO [culture] to arise and any existing culture to disappear
- instead, assemble a team of people in it for the long-haul and you can build an AMAZING team long-term if you can work out the forming/storming/norming/performing kinks

A good employer looks for specific attributes:
- Character - honest and demonstrates integrity
- Competence - can read a situation and act appropriately
- Chemistry - personality fits well with others in the organization

Most hiring processes are geared around the needs of the average candidate, not the best.
For the average candidate, a new job is a tactical move based on short-term criteria.
For the best, it's a strategic move.

Top people aren't going to apply for run-of-the-mill jobs that seem the same as everyone else's.

When anyone on the interviewing team finds a candidate they think is hot, they go into immediate sales mode. They also stop listening and stop evaluating competency in a transparent attempt to excite the hot prospect on the merits of the job. This cheapens the job and drives many top people away.

Top people don't look for jobs based on their skills and experience. They look for jobs based on the challenges and opportunities.

Define what people need to do with their skills and experiences.

Forget the clever questions. Instead, dig deeply into a person's major accomplishments to observe trends of growth and patterns of behaviors.

Hiring great people is the single most important thing you can do to ensure your own success.

Use standard search-engine techniques to allow top people to quickly find their open positions.

Your openings are prominently featured on the first page of your corporate website.

Make it fun and compelling.

Track the end-to-end yield of those initially viewing an ad to those actually applying.

Don't differentiate on money, differentiate on opportunity.

Recruiting the best is not about selling or charming. It's about providing big challenges and career opportunities and a little money thrown in.

Examine all aspects of your hiring process from the perspective of a top person who has little time to spare and multiple opportunities.

Core steps: defining the job, sourcing, interviewing, assessing, and recruiting.
Redesign each of these steps from the perspective of a top candidate, and then integrate them into a systematic business process.
While each step is relatively easy to solve, fixing all of them and making sure they stay fixed for all candidates is the secret to making the hiring of top talent a systematic business process.

A performance profile is what the person taking the job needs to do to be considered successful.

Describe the real job, not the person taking the job.

Write compelling job descriptions that describe real job needs, not ads that emphasize skills and qualifications.

It should be so clearly written that your top candidate could show it to his circle of personal advisors and easily convince them this is a true career move.

Design every aspect of sourcing to attract top people (whether active or passive), which includes where you place the exciting job descriptions, how you design the career web site, how you get referrals, and when you make phone calls.

First define superior performance. Performance is about results, not about skills and qualifications.

Every job, from entry-level to CEO, has six to eight performance objectives that define job success. These objectives spell out what the person in the job must do to be considered successful,

Specific: Include the details of what needs to be done so that others understand it.
Measurable: It's best if the objective is easy to measure by including amounts or percent changes.
Action-oriented: Action verbs build, improve, change, and help understanding.
Results: A definition that complements the measurable piece by clearly indicating what needs to happen.
Time-bound: Include a date or state how long it will take to start and complete.
Environment: Describe the company culture, pace, pressure, available resources, and politics.

Categories: effectively dealing with people, achieving objectives, organizing teams, solving problems, using technology, and making changes.
Creating these performance objectives starts by asking what the person taking the job needs to do to be successful, not what the person needs to have.

First, determine the top six to eight performance objectives in general terms, then get more specific. The hiring team needs to put the final performance objectives in priority order.
1. Define the majorobjectives. Determine what a person taking this job needs to do over the next 6 to 12 months to be considered successful. Most jobs have two to three major objectives
2. Develop subobjectives. For each major objective, determine the two or three things a successful person would need to do to achieve the major objective.
3. Ask questions to make sure you have all of the key objectives.
4. Convert having to doing.
5. Convert technical skills into results.

Make the creation of these requirements a primary performance objective.

During the first interview, the president and the candidate (who ultimately got the job) spent two hours together developing a detailed operational plan for this new business.

Determine what the best performers already in the job do differently from everyone else, then look for these same abilities in the people you hire.
Also study the worst people, discover what they do that makes them poor performers, and then avoid these traits.

Your employee base needs to mimic your customer base.

Compensation is not the primary consideration. The opportunity and challenges inherent in the job are.

Top people want to work for leaders and mentors who can help them reach their goals.

Tie the actual job to some major company initiative

Great ads must meet three criteria:
1. Have a compelling title
2. Write copy that's focused on what the candidate will learn, do, and become.
3. Describe the most critical skills in the context of how they're used.

Call the best candidates within 24 hours.
If someone applies on your site, you'll need to make sure your backend search engine automatically brings this person to the top of the list.

To be a leader of the company, what qualities do you look for?
A: You clearly want somebody who can articulate a vision. They have to have enormous energy and the incredible ability to energize others.
If you can't energize others, you can't be a leader. -Jack Welch

30% PLUS Solution = Job Stretch + Job Growth + $$ Increase + Manager's Total Involvement

You can't tell a person how great a job is. The person needs to learn it on his own.

He tells prospective employees: "If you need me to motivate you, I probably don't want to hire you."

Precisely spell out what you want done, how it is to be done, and the desired measurable outcome once it is done.

Know what kinds of special skills or experience are required to do the job most effectively.

Hiring inexperienced employees:
It's easier to teach someone, than to unteach them first.

It's not easy to find energetic and enthusiastic people with the right attitude. We look for people who can grow into their work, and respond with excitement when we give them greater responsibility.

Most really successful people I've met are more interested in doing the right and proper thing than the easy and expedient one.

Good employees accept responsibility.
Great employees seek responsibility.

You'll attract the employees you need if you can explain why your mission is compelling, why you're doing something important that no one else is going to get done.

You should be able to explain why your company is a unique match for him personally. And if you can't do that, he's probably not the right match.

John D. Rockefeller Sr. hired talented people whenever he found them,
rather than according to need, confident that Standard Oil's growth
would create many spots to fill.

He recognized talent even in opponents.

Perot put extraordinary effort into evaluating new hires. He devised a
20-page application that asked candidates, among other questions, what
they considered the greatest accomplishments of their lives. He met with
the wives of the candidates, exploring whether they would tolerate the
demands that EDS would put on their husbands. In the early days, a
candidate did not get hired before interviewing with every single
existing EDS employee.

While Microsoft has attracted aggressively intellectual types
characterized as clones of Bill Gates, Sam Walton's top aides were
typically ambitious small-town men like himself.
Wayne Huizenga's senior managers have tended to be former football
players with middle-class, Midwestern backgrounds.
Ross Perot created EDS in his own image by hiring hard chargers with
military backgrounds.
In recruiting people who shared their views of the world, however, the
billionaires did not seek yes-men.
Confident enough not to feel threatenedby strong subordinates, they
generally valued aides who were willing to defend opposing points of view.

The hiring process is the first and most essential medium for communicating the Boss' idea.
HIRING:
1. scripted presentation communicating the Boss' idea in a group meeting to all the applicants at once. describe the idea, history, successful experience implementing the idea, attributes required of the successful candidate for the position.
2. meeting with each applicant individually to discuss reactions and feelings about the idea, as well as his background and experience. ask why they feel they're great for the role in implementing the idea.
3. notify successful candidate by phone.
4. notify unsuccessful applicants, thanking for their interest.
5. first day of training:
- reviewing boss' idea
- summarizing the system
- take a tour of facilities, highlighting people at work, systems at work, to demonstrate the interdependence of systems on people and people on systems
- answering employee's questions fully
- give operations manual
- review operations manual
- completing employment papers

Don't hire experienced managers, because they'll manage by standards they learned somewhere else.
You must take full accountability for what's going on in your business. You must lead the company in the direction you intend it to go.
You must set the standard.
The Management System : all managers and future-managers are expected to produce results.
You don't need professional managers to manage to those standards : just people who wish to learn how to manage them. People who are personally committed to those standards as you are.

You need people who want to play your game. Not people who believe they have a better one.

Let people with the best resumes make the decisions. Of course, a company's leader ultimately must take responsibility for the decision, but the best leaders let themselves be heavily influenced by advisers with the appropriate experience and training.

HIRE A VERSION OF YOURSELF:
Find someone who does every checklist task you do, probably better than you do it. Take the part of your job you can describe in a manual, and hire someone to do it. Find something to do but to do it so well that it more than paid for the person you just hired to do your old job.
Then you can spend all your time not just imagining a bigger, better future but also making it happen.
If you didn't have to spend your time in meetings and reacting to incoming, no one would be standing in the way of your ability to generate value and insight and forward motion. The people with more leverage than you don't work any harder than you do. They've hired people to do that. No, the people with more leverage than you do are making better art.

HIRE SOMEONE WHOM YOU CAN WORK FOR:
Entrepreneurs often do this when they raise money from venture capitalists. The VCs end up on the board; they are the ones who demand quarterly results and who scour spreadsheets and corporate-strategy decks and then give their permission. Painters do this when they sign on with a gallery instead of selling their work directly to the public. Musicians do it when they give away all their rights to a record label
The trade-off is that you will give up the freedom to decide what sort of art you're going to make.
