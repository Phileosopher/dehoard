Odd people and ordinary people get a co-dependent kick out of being needed and liked by each other.

If you're going to be an entrepreneur, be prepared to work with people who not only don't follow the rutted path of the masses but openly shun it. After all, that's why these people are willing to listen to you and your fundamentally innovative ideas in the first place.
