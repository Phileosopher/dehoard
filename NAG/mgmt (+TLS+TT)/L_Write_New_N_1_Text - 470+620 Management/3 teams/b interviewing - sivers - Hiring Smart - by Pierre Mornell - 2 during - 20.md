
Interviews test how well someone interviews.

Trust your gut. Chemistry is usually determined in the first few minutes of an interview.

'Never do business with anybody you don't like.' If you don't like somebody, there's a reason. Chances are it's because you don't trust them, and you're probably right.

As the official interview commences, as the starter's gun cracks and the race begins, ask all your questions at once. That's right. Put all your initial questions on the table up front. This strategy accomplishes three things. First, in a manner of speaking, you pass the baton. You've asked the questions, now the candidate must respond. Performance depends upon the candidate, not selling yourself and the organization. Second, and more importantly, this strategy directly confronts the most common problem in interviewing: not listening, and talking too much.

This technique forces you to listen.

Settle back and watch a candidate's behavior as well as listen to his or her words.

How do you recognize incompetence? What do you do about it?

How do you recognize excellence? What do you do with it? What about yourself would you like to improve most? What makes you lose your temper? Tell me about the last time it happened.

"Are you lucky?"

Henry Ford's favorite question, "Are you curious?"

Disingenuous questions.

"I'm just a legal and financial guy who never really understood the HR department. What exactly does a HR director do?" If the candidate could explain the job in detail, clearly and concisely, Larry went on to the next question. Watch out if the candidate spoke in jargon and buzzwords.

"How are you going to lose money for me?"

Three quarters of the way through the interview, give the candidate a task to perform. Not only does this demonstrate the candidate's behavior - it also breaks the monotony of most interviews.

The interviewer asks the candidate how she would market the new furniture and why.

"We have about five more minutes …" is a useful statement before closure. Pay attention to "By the way …," "Oh, one more thing …," and "I almost forgot …," which mean, "This is the most important thing I'm going to say."

Our strengths, in the extreme, may predict our weaknesses. Therefore ask candidates about their strengths, and consider what might exist on the other side.

If candidates can go into detail and depth about a subject, they probably have some expertise in that area. If not, the opposite is true. On the other hand, the key is to ask questions in your areas of expertise.

Use a pad with a line drawn down the middle. On one side of the page, make appropriate notes about what the candidate tells you regarding jobs, dates, strengths, weaknesses, etc. On the other side, note what you're thinking. Nothing is too minor to write down: questions, missing pieces, thoughts, feelings, likes, dislikes.

I have all candidates sign a release form, an at-will clause, and an arbitration agreement three times during the hiring process. They sign when they fill out an application, co-sign an employment agreement, and after they read our policy and procedures manual.
