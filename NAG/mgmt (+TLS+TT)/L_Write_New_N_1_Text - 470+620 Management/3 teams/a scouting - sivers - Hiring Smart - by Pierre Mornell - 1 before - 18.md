
Before the initial interview, pick up the phone and call the candidate.

How hard or easy is it to reach the candidate? Does the candidate return your call at the specific times that you suggest?

I review time, place, and dress for the initial interview by phone.

Five to 10 percent of interviewees will screw up this first test.

Regardless of the material already in your file, ask the candidate to send a resume with a one-page cover letter that briefly highlights his or her life and background.

Is the response slow or prompt? How long before the letter and resume arrive by mail or fax? Is the candidate literate or illiterate? Sloppy or neat?

65 percent of executive candidates lie about their academic credentials. Forty-three percent lie about their job responsibilities. Forty-two percent lie about previous compensation.

A resume must always be verified.

It is a red light if a person behaves deceptively on something as basic as a resume.

Ask the candidate to visit one of your stores, plants, campuses, offices, or Web page before the interview. Then ask for the candidate's observations.

Most candidates wait for the beginning of the "official" interview like a runner waits for the starter's gun to fire. These few minutes are a terrific opportunity to take a brief stroll about the office and make small talk, while lowering anxieties. "How was your drive? Any trouble finding the office? Would you like some coffee?" Look for curiosity - does the candidate ask questions? What other behavior does the candidate exhibit?

Curiosity is a valuable asset in an employee. It demonstrates a desire to gratify the mind with new discoveries, to learn about novel and extraordinary things.

Read the top candidates' resumes in teams of three to five people. Watch for one of your team members to emerge, often unpredictably, as your in-house resume expert.

Let a wide range of people know that you're looking.

What Dave observed at the dinner party and hotel were the potential candidates' behaviors. Casting the widest net possible, he is always on the lookout for the best candidates available,

Microsoft assumes that the best candidates are not looking for new jobs. In fact, candidates who approach Microsoft are actually less attractive to the company.

Hiring people from big companies to little companies, top-down to bottom-up organizations, or structured to entrepreneurial settings, can be a dangerous route.

Before interviewing new candidates for old jobs, it's an excellent time to rethink the job itself.

Keep your initial interview short.
