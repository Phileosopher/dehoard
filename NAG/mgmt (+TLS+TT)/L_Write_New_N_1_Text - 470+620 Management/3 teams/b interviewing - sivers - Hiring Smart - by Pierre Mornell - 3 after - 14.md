
Before a candidate leaves my office I make a simple request. "Please call me back on Monday."

I say, "You'll probably have a few thoughts on the way home, maybe some questions, so let's talk for five minutes, even to touch base, if you're available by phone next week." Then we settle on a time and day.

Give finalist candidates a current project you're evaluating and ask for an analysis.

Give finalist candidates a post-interview project that evaluates attention to detail, as well as the ability to analyze problems and suggest solutions.

Meet the candidate's spouse or significant other.

What worries or anxieties does that person have about the candidate's possible job?

For the candidate worried about his sick child's health insurance, or about missing Little League practice with his son, or about his spouse's isolation, these issues need to be addressed, fully and satisfactorily, in advance of new employment.

Always have a final interview in which you talk about potential problems.

If you've not discovered any, you're missing something in the candidate's background.

Your goal is to address whatever difficulties might arise.

Give prospective employees a fifteen-minute psychological inventory.

Offer the assurance that there are no right or wrong answers.

I'm not as interested in the MBTI results, which identify a candidate as one of sixteen personality types, as I am in how long it takes to return the inventory, and how the person discusses the results, which we always do by phone or in a follow-up visit.

In our conversation afterward, the candidate has plenty of time to agree or disagree with the test results as it fits her personality. More significantly in terms of my task, does the candidate laugh? Does she elaborate on her independence? Her rigidities? Does she give examples? Do the results open up our discussion? Or does she clam up? Does the candidate think she can make an end run by saying, in all seriousness, as many candidates do, "Oh, I used to be like that, but I've really changed over the years."
