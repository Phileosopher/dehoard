
Smaller teams are more effective than larger teams because as group size
grows, more attention is devoted to running the group and less to the
task at hand.

done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves."

make sure someone is responsible to keep track of the changes in everyone's authority
- assign people appropriately the the various scopes of that authority within your organization
- if it's 100% clear who did what at what time, it's much easier to track down errors and who did it

Anne Mulcahy, who as CEO of Xerox announced that executives, on a
rotating basis, would have to serve as the customer officer of the day.
The customer officer would have to deal with every customer complaint
that came into corporate headquarters that day. Mulcahy said, "It keeps
us in touch with the real world." It made the stock four times more
valuable.
- everyone must have SOME sympathy for all the people they work with
- if they don't, the whole group quickly devolves into a tribalized [bad system]
- this is a CONSTANT need, especially since every new person (and [personality]) is going to change the group slightly

A team forms through several stages

A. Forming - relationships established in the group, goals are clarified, the manager defines the team's goals and tasks
- Marked by avoiding conflict and relationships formed
- Avoiding conflict yields very little work accomplished
- Its length depends on how clear tasks are defined and everyone's experience in the team
- Autonomous people, complicated tasks, or a variety of tasks will slow down the Forming stage
- The manager is very "hands-on" in this stage

B. Storming - team members feel capable of expressing and questioning opinions
- More evidence of internal conflict
- The manager will try to direct nervous energy into something productive
- Morale will dip when strongly expressed views and differences between expectations and reality appear
- Storming will resolve relatively quickly without any guidance or support and is necessary for the team to work together
- Team members will try to console and encourage everyone involved
- A manager who tries to force through this stage can permanently splinter the group

C. Norming - team focuses on resolving differences to define the mission and goals
- Marked by trust, mutual respect, cohesion, and harmony
- Team members learn more about each other and how they work together
- The team sets core standards about conduct, values, and measuring performance
- The manager is now a team member with everyone else
- The team starts developing a sense of team pride and productivity increases from it

D. Performing - genuine benefits to the organization
- Marked by high levels of loyalty, cohesiveness, shared work as an autonomous unit, and confident decisions
- The team completes work at each stage, but Performing is the most productive
- The manager is now an overseer who delegates tasks
- Team members feel confident and eager to be part of the team
- Everyone is optimistic about the outcome, openly communicates, and is highly energetic
- Everyone expects disagreement and encourages it as long as members channel it through a meaningful process the team agrees on

Labor can often be organized more efficiently in the context of community than it can in the context of a corporation. The best person to do a job is the one who most wants to do that job; and the best people to evaluate their performance are their friends and peers who, by the way, will enthusiastically pitch in to improve the final product simply for the sheer pleasure of helping one another and creating something beautiful from which they will all benefit.

Make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing. Defining roles reduces conflict. Most fights inside a company happen when colleagues compete for the same responsibilities.

## Teams

Hiring is the most critical thing you do in a team, so allocate time and effort accordingly.

Use the smallest team possible, but no smaller.

Do everything you can to keep the team size small. Remove distractions for the team, delegate work that isn’t crucial, provide tools that help their productivity. Increasing the team size should be the last resort.

Teams need to be carefully grown, not quickly put together. When companies brag about how many engineers they’re planning to hire in the near future, this is a massive red flag.

New systems are best designed by a small numbers of minds, not committees. Once the structure of the system is clear and the main decisions made, more people can usefully get involved.

Code ownership may be undesirable, but it’s important to have someone who owns the overall vision and direction for a system. Without it, the architecture will degrade over time as it gets pulled in different directions.

Prefer paying more to get a smaller number of great people instead of hiring more people at a lower salary.

Use contractors to bring in expertise, to ramp up a project quickly, for work on trial projects, or to deal with specialised work of a temporary nature. Don’t use contractors as a substitute for ordinary staff. (I say this as a contractor.)

If you’re hiring contractors because you can’t get permanent staff, you’re not paying your permanent staff enough.

As a team lead, if things go well, give your team the credit. If things go badly, take the blame yourself.

A team member who isn’t a good fit for the team can kill the performance of the whole team.

Inter-personal conflict is likewise poison to a team. While it may be possible to resolve underlying issues, if it proves difficult, it’s usually better for everyone to accept this and move people on.

Many people do “agile” badly, but that doesn’t mean that “agile” is bad.

Out of all the agile practices commonly used, estimating task sizes and trying to measure project velocity is the least useful. (Its utility is often less than zero).
