gangs are essentially [youth](maturity)-formed organizations that implement a type of order that is absent from the rest of society
- essentially, a lack of sufficient [parenting], specifically fathers, creates a tremendous [void](unknown) in a young person's life, and a gang forms the [meaning] they desperately need by giving that young person a set of [rules] to live by, and by giving a type of [family] (though certainly [criminal]) that they have at least some [hope](certainty) legitimately [loves] them
- the tragedy is that there really is no love, and the organization is run by [power-mongering] and [evil] people, and they simply need ANYONE who will give at least some [human decency](humanity) to them
- even worse, many of them are truly misguided enough that they see loving, normal people as either inferior (because they haven't had the same [experiences](understanding)) or an [antagonist](stories) to their [purposes]
- the only rehabilitation comes from them realizing there's a legitimate [void](unknown) in their life after [attaining](results) at least some things, then someone in their life being present to give [guidance](understanding) of a better way to live

these gangs use key signifiers for in-group [identity]:
- a vetting process that's often very brutal or extremely difficult, often to test [aptitude](results)
- conveyed [myths] that give a grander sense of [meaning], often in a [religious] context
- hidden hand signals or gestures
- matching clothing or accessories
- specific [language] or forms of speech
- specific information specific to their role in that group

the irony of gangs is that they often DO render a valuable service
- frequently, they'll serve where government can't serve (e.g., homeless shelters, schools, etc.)
- the people at large are often willing to overlook the bad things because of the social good those gangs provide

the only difference between a good group and a [bad system] has a lot to do with what the implementation points to:
- if it provides a good service, irrespective of its illegality, it's good
- if it's sending something that is BOTH [illegal] and [immoral], it's bad
- if it's doing something that [claims](image) to be good but isn't helping anyone, it's bad

the future of a bad group member comes to a few fates:
1. they stay in the group, solely devoted to that group, and are eventually exploited
2. if the group member finds a community OUTSIDE the organization, they'll hybridize that group with their other group
3. they try to become a force for good inside the organization, and often become a cautionary tale or martyr if they imply the group needs to [change]
4. they quietly leave the organization and [never integrate their shadow], and fade from any public attention
5. they become a force for good, OUTSIDE the organization, working against that organization
- even sending someone to prison or some other institution doesn't fix it: it has to be a personal decision

bad systems technically only lose political power because another system was sufficient enough to replace it
- it's a [trend], but almost inevitable proportionally to how much people hate the bad system
- in other words, spreading hate of the bad system (and ideally through [love] of a good thing the bad system is supposed to advocate) is the number one way to inspire the [trend] towards mindedness of a replacement

MONOLITHIC OUTSIDER THEORY (MAY GO TO MY RULES)
- every outsider of an organization imagines a group to be monolithic and huge, but the people inside has as much [in-fighting] and [power struggles] as anything else
