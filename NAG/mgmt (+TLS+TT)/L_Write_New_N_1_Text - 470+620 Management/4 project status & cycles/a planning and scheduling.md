How does one schedule an event where the Japanese will turn up 10
minutes early, the Germans and the Swiss on time, the Americans and

- very lenient timetables is a REALLY good idea, proportionally to the variance of the [cultures] in the team

Once all the threats have been surfaced, the project team can Prepare to
Be Wrong by adapting its plans to forestall as many of the negative
scenarios as possible.

The project management triangle:

company based in Silicon Valley, is audaciously simple and simply
audacious. Salaried employees can take as much time off as they'd like,

work day, these employees wondered, why should it track how many
holidays people were taking each work year?

Any time someone starts a sentence with "All you need to do is…" or

Rate yourself.
Where do you see yourself in the Dreyfus model for the primary skills

Think back to problems you've experienced on a project team. Could any
of them have been avoided if the team had been aware of the Dreyfus model?
What can you do differently going forward?

Positive emotions are essential to learning and creative thinking. Being
"happy" broadens your thought processes and brings more of the brain's
hardware online.

destroyed. Time can only be allocated.
