
Fixing on a decision prematurely reduces your options, perhaps to the
point of eliminating the successful choice.

You'll learn a little bit more every day. You'll learn more about the
users, the project itself, your team, and the technology. That means
you'll be at your peak of intelligence at the very end of the project
and at your most ignorant at the very beginning. So, do you want to make
decisions early on? No; you want to defer closure for as long as
possible in order to make a better decision later. But that means
critical issues may stay unsettled for a long time, which makes many
people acutely uncomfortable. Resist the pressure. Know that you will
reach a decision, and the matter will be settled, just not today.

Agile software development embraces the idea of working with
uncertainty. Early on, you don't know what the project end date will
really be. You're not 100 percent certain which features will be present
in the next iteration. You don't know how many iterations there will be.
And that's perfectly OK: that's the sort of uncertainty you want to be
comfortable with.

Lead. Do not be led. You have employed smart people. Great. But you are their leader. If you sniff an opportunity, get them to consider it. If they still don't get excited, take the project into your private office and begin it there. Do not leave the opportunity within the company to be sabotaged, focus-grouped and committeed to death.
