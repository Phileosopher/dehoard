
## SCHEDULES

Schedules serve 3 functions : allow for commitments to be made, for people to see their work as a contribution to the whole, tracking of progress.

Schedules give the team a tool to track progress and to break work into manageable chunks.
Big schedules should be divided into small schedules to minimize risks, increase frequency of adjustments.
Breaking things down into one-or-two day sizes helps people understand what the work is that they need to do.
A good schedule gives a clearer view of the project, flushes out challenges and oversights, and makes it more likely that good things will happen.

For ANY project, break the available time into three equal parts: (1) DESIGN, (2) IMPLEMENTATION, (3) TESTING.
The zero-sum nature of projects surfaces : adding new features requires more than just a programmer implementing them, there are unavoidable design and testing costs that someone has to pay.

The earlier estimates are made, the less accurate they are, but rough estimates are the only way to make a starting point for better ones.
When schedules slip, there were hidden or ignored costs that were never accounted for.
Schedules should be made with skepticism.

Create detailed schedules for limited periods of time only.

A schedule doesn't have to be perfect, just good enough for the team and leaders to believe in, provide a basis for tracking and making adjustments, and have a probability of success that satisfies the client.
If leaders acknowledge weak estimates in the schedule, and are comfortable with greater schedule risk, there's nothing wrong with weak estimates. On smaller, faster projects, rough estimates may be enough.

Good estimates are everyone's business, and it should be the work of the entire team.

Lack of clarity on higher-level objectives has a direct influence on the low-level assumptions programmers make.

QUESTIONS THAT HELP CATCH SCHEDULE PROBLEMS:
* Were sick days, holidays and vacation time for all contributors included?
* Do individuals have access to the schedule, and asked to report regular progress?
* Is someone watching overall schedule on daily/weekly basis?
* Does the team feel ownership and commitment to the schedule? (If not, did they contribute?)
* Do leaders add more feature requests than they help eliminate? Do leaders say "no" to new work and provide a philosophy to the team for how to respond to new (late) requests?
* Are people on the team encouraged to say "no" to new work requests that don't fit the goals and vision?
* Are there moments in the schedule when adjustments and renegotiations can take place by leaders?
* Are specs and design plans good enough for engineering to make good work estimates?
* Is engineering trained in making good work estimates?
