When you say to someone "What do you need?" you're giving them a
homework assignment - to figure out what they need help with.

When we reach a midpoint between a known start and finish, a mental
siren alerts us that we've squandered half of our time.
That injects a healthy dose of stress - Uh-oh, we're running out of
time! - that revives our motivation and reshapes our strategy.
Teams made their most significant progress during a concentrated
midpoint burst.

Rules and policies and regulations and stipulations are innovation
killers. People do their best work when they're unencumbered.

How to detect a lousy management chart
- 1 the numbers can be removed and the information represents itself the same
- percentages that don't add up to 100%
- no source data to reference (such as a reporting agency
- 2 jargon-heavy
  - this may even have the reductionism present in most good UX cases
  - the information is opaque enough for the manager to "broadly interpret" it
- 3 thoroughly jargon-dense explanations precluding AND concluding the dataset
  - little to no numerical indicators or added understanding inside the body text

You want thinking, responsible developers. Overreliance on formal models
will tend to reward herd behavior and devalue individual creativity.

By targeting your methodology to novices, you will create a poor working
environment for the experienced team members,

Novices need quick successes and context-free rules. You can't expect
them to be able to handle novel situations on their own. Given a problem
space, they'll stop to consider everything, whether it's relevant or
not. Don't confuse them unnecessarily with the big picture.

Experts need to have access to the big picture; don't cripple them with
restrictive, bureaucratic rules that aim to replace judgment. You want
the benefit of their expert judgment.

SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and
Time-boxed. For any goal you have in mind (losing weight, deposing your
boss, conquering the world, and so on), you need to have a plan: a
series of objectives that will help get to your goal. Each objective
should have the SMART characteristics.

Measurable goes hand-in-hand with being specific. It's hard to measure
something general and abstract but much easier to measure something
concrete and specific - using actual numbers. If you think you can't
measure your objective, then it's probably not specific enough.
