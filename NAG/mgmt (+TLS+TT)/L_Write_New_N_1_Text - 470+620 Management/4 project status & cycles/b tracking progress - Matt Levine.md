
## Wells Fargo!

In 2016, Wells Fargo & Co. got in trouble for [opening fake accounts](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35707099.284777/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTYtMDktMDkvd2VsbHMtZmFyZ28tb3BlbmVkLWEtY291cGxlLW1pbGxpb24tZmFrZS1hY2NvdW50cz9jbXBpZD1CQkQwNjEzMjRfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yNDA2MTMmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/60e87ce39a995a4b1a2deb96Be65154cb). What happened was that Wells Fargo’s senior management had decided that it wanted its branch employees to cross-sell products, to push each checking customer to open up a savings account and a credit card and sign up for online banking and maybe get a mortgage, because this would deepen the bank’s relationship with the customer and ultimately lead to more revenue. But instead of hiring and training employees who would holistically assess each customer’s needs and suggest suitable products, Wells Fargo had “strict quotas regulating the number of daily ‘solutions’ that its bankers must reach,” and its managers would “constantly hound, berate, demean and threaten employees to meet these unreachable quotas.”

And so the employees, rather than working with each customer to build a suite of products that met the customer’s needs and deepened her relationship with the bank, would just go and open a bunch of fake accounts. They’d sign the customer up for online banking and a credit card and a savings account _without her knowledge_, because then they could check off their quotas and move on. This was bad. Wells Fargo paid a lot of fines and went through a lot of public rending of garments.

The problem, it seemed to me, was that Wells Fargo — a giant company with thousands of employees — was stuck managing its employees by crude metrics (how many “solutions” they opened) rather than with a nuanced understanding of the business and their contributions to it.

You want a lot of products opened, you get a lot of products opened, but in a bad way. It’s a case of [Goodhart’s law](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35707099.284777/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvR29vZGhhcnQlMjdzX2xhdw/60e87ce39a995a4b1a2deb96Bb919ca13): “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”

Wells Fargo is the absolute poster child for Goodhart’s law.

Ahahaha come on. You want a lot of mouse movement, you get a lot of mouse movement, but in a bad way. Imagine deciding how to measure and manage the productivity and value added of your wealth and investment management employees while they are working from home. What might you measure?

1. These people manage portfolios. You could measure their investment return, or return against a benchmark, or their alpha after adjusting for various market, sector and style factors. You could measure how many assets they attract and retain, or how much they generate in fees.
2. These people deal with clients. You could measure how many clients they bring in, or how many client assets. You could survey the clients and grade the employees based on customer satisfaction. You could even, crudely, have some metric like “call three clients every day,” and make sure they do that.
3. These people sit at computers. You could _monitor their computers to make sure that they’re moving the mouse at least once every five minutes for eight hours a day_.

Which of those do you think is the best proxy for, like, contributions to Wells Fargo’s return on equity? Which is the simplest to measure? Which is the simplest to game?
