The best SDLC available was [waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) with all of its problems that were not lost on us even then. The whole industry did very long release projects, such as two months of requirements gathering and design specification followed by nine months of coding and then three months of testing. Even if we did see then (and we mostly didn't) that small, frequent releases were better in a whole bunch of ways, we couldn't really do it. It was expensive to ship on physical media, and disruptive to our customers to have to do frequent installs.
