In any team, there are 3 goals to always maintain awareness of:
1. Ideal - never attainable, but we [imagine] it when we don't have experience in the domain, NEVER set standards based on this goal
2. Likely - based on constraints (e.g., schedules, life events like [weddings], [new baby] etc., and [hardships]; moves around a lot, but grows higher as workers gain experience in doing things, set all incentives based on this
3. Required - based on VERY hard and measurable constraints (e.g., time, money), gets more severe consequences the larger a project grows if they're not met, set all disciplinary action based on this

"Bookending," which involves estimating two different scenarios: a dire
scenario (the lower bookend), and a rosy scenario (the upper bookend).

"The future is uncertain, so my investments can't hinge on knowing the
future. I look for situations where the bookends suggest that I can
invest wisely without knowing exactly what the future holds."

Imagine the future "death" of a project and ask, "What killed it?"

unlike [entrepreneurship] or any other personal [decision], ALL management (and to some extent [family] matters as well) REQUIRE a phased approach:
1. Current Situation is in place
2. New Situation runs parallel to Current Situation, with constant communication of Current Situation being phased out
3. Eventually, New Situation is 100% on-track for Current Situation to work well
4. Current Situation is given a public warning of deactivation (if anyone is still there) with instructions to move to New Situation
5. keep maintaining Current Situation until it's completely outmoded (and even a bit farther for [legal](legally safe) and [tax] reasons

A survey of American homeowners who had remodeled their kitchens found
that, on average, they had expected the job to cost $18,658; in fact,
they ended up paying an average of $38,769.

The greatest responsibility for avoiding the planning fallacy lies with
the decision makers who approve the plan.

If they do not recognize the need for an outside view, they commit a
planning fallacy.

The prevalent tendency to underweight or ignore distributional
information is perhaps the major source of error in forecasting.
Planners should therefore make every effort to frame the forecasting
problem so as to facilitate utilizing all the distributional information
that is available. This may be considered the single most important
piece of advice regarding how to increase accuracy in forecasting
through improved methods.

Identify an appropriate reference class (kitchen renovations, large
railway projects, etc.). Obtain the statistics of the reference class
(in terms of cost per mile of railway, or of the percentage by which
expenditures exceeded budget). Use the statistics to generate a baseline
prediction. Use specific information about the case to adjust the
baseline prediction, if there are particular reasons to expect the
optimistic bias to be more or less pronounced in this project than in
others of the same type.

Executives too easily fall victim to the planning fallacy. In its grip,
they make decisions based on delusional optimism rather than on a
rational weighting of gains, losses, and probabilities. They
overestimate benefits and underestimate costs. They spin scenarios of
success while overlooking the potential for mistakes and
miscalculations. As a result, they pursue initiatives that are unlikely
to come in on budget or on time or to deliver the expected returns - or
even to be completed. In this view, people often (but not always) take
on risky projects because they are overly optimistic about the odds they
face.

This is an explanation of why people litigate, why they start wars, and
why they open small businesses.

If you are genetically endowed with an optimistic bias, you hardly need
to be told that you are a lucky person - you already feel fortunate. An
optimistic attitude is largely inherited, and it is part of a general
disposition for well-being, which may also include a preference for
seeing the bright side of everything. If you were allowed one wish for
your child, seriously consider wishing him or her optimism. Optimists
are normally cheerful and happy, and therefore popular; they are
resilient in adapting to failures and hardships, their chances of
clinical depression are reduced, their immune system is stronger, they
take better care of their health, they feel healthier than others and
are in fact likely to live longer. A study of people who exaggerate
their expected life span beyond actuarial predictions showed that they
work longer hours, are more optimistic about their future

Optimistic individuals play a disproportionate role in shaping our
lives. Their decisions make a difference; they are the inventors, the
entrepreneurs, the political and military leaders - not average people.
They got to where they are by seeking challenges and taking risks. They
are talented and they have been lucky, almost certainly luckier than
they acknowledge.

The people who have the greatest influence on the lives of others are
likely to be optimistic and overconfident, and to take more risks than
they realize.

These persistent (or obstinate) individuals doubled their initial losses
before giving up. Significantly, persistence after discouraging advice
was relatively common among inventors who had a high score on a
personality measure of optimism.

The damage caused by overconfident CEOs is compounded when the business
press anoints them as celebrities; the evidence indicates that
prestigious press awards to the CEO are costly to stockholders. The
authors write, "We find that firms with award-winning CEOs subsequently
underperform, in terms both of stock and of operating performance. At
the same time, CEO compensation increases, CEOs spend more time on
activities outside the company such as writing books and sitting on
outside boards, and they are more likely to engage in earnings management."

To explain entrepreneurial optimism, cognitive biases play an important
role.

We focus on our goal, anchor on our plan, and neglect relevant base
rates, exposing ourselves to the planning fallacy. We focus on what we
want to do and can do, neglecting the plans and skills of others. Both
in explaining the past and in predicting the future, we focus on the
causal role of skill and neglect the role of luck. We are therefore
prone to an illusion of control. We focus on what we know and neglect
what we do not know, which makes us overly confident in our beliefs.

I have had several occasions to ask founders and participants in
innovative start-ups a question: To what extent will the outcome of your
effort depend on what you do in your firm? This is evidently an easy
question; the answer comes quickly and in my small sample it has never
been less than 80%. Even when they are not sure they will succeed, these
bold people think their fate is almost entirely in their own hands. They
are surely wrong: the outcome of a start-up depends as much on the
achievements of its competitors and on changes in the market as on its
own efforts. However, WY SIATI plays its part, and entrepreneurs
naturally focus on what they know best - their plans and actions and the
most immediate threats and opportunities, such as the availability of
funding. They know less about their competitors and therefore find it
natural to imagine a future in which the competition plays little part.

Entrepreneurial firms that fail but signal new markets to more qualified
competitors "optimistic martyrs" - good for the economy but bad for
their investors.

A survey in which the chief financial officers of large corporations
estimated the returns of the Standard & Poor's index over the following
year. The Duke scholars collected 11,600 such forecasts and examined
their accuracy. The conclusion was straightforward: financial officers
of large corporations had no clue about the short-term future of the
stock market; the correlation between their estimates and the true value
was slightly less than zero! When they said the market would go down, it
was slightly more likely than not that it would go up.

The answer that a truthful CFO would offer is plainly ridiculous. A CFO
who informs his colleagues that "there is a good chance that the S&P
returns will be between -10% and +30%" can expect to be laughed out of
the room. The wide confidence interval is a confession of ignorance,
which is not socially acceptable for someone who is paid to be
knowledgeable in financial matters. Even if they knew how little they
know, the executives would be penalized for admitting it.

The emotional, cognitive, and social factors that support exaggerated
optimism are a heady brew, which sometimes leads people to take risks
that they would avoid if they knew the odds.

The contribution of optimism to good implementation is certainly
positive. The main benefit of optimism is resilience in the face of
setbacks.

Someone who lacks a delusional sense of significance will wilt in the
face of repeated experiences of multiple small failures and rare
successes, the fate of most small business.

When the organization has almost come to an important decision but has
not formally committed itself, Klein proposes gathering for a brief
session a group of individuals who are knowledgeable about the decision.
The premise of the session is a short speech: "Imagine that we are a
year into the future. We implemented the plan as it now exists. The
outcome was a disaster. Please take 5 to 10 minutes to write a brief
history of that disaster."

Premortem has two main advantages: it overcomes the groupthink that
affects many teams once a decision appears to have been made, and it
unleashes the imagination of knowledgeable individuals in a much-needed
direction.
