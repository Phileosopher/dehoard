A line-by-line, day-by-day listing of every building task that needed to
be accomplished, in what order, and when.

The whole checklist is sent to the subcontractors and other independent
experts so they can double-check that everything is correct, that
nothing has been missed.

What results is remarkable: a succession of day-by-day checks that guide
how the building is constructed and ensure that the knowledge of
hundreds, perhaps thousands, is put to use in the right place at the
right time in the right way.

Submittal schedule specified communication tasks. Managers dealt with
the unexpected and the uncertain by making sure the experts spoke to one
another - on X date regarding Y process. The experts could make their
individual judgments, but they had to do so as part of a team that took
one another's concerns into account, discussed unplanned developments,
and agreed on the way forward. While no one could anticipate all the
problems, they could foresee where and when they might occur. The
checklist therefore detailed who had to talk to whom, by which date, and
about what.
