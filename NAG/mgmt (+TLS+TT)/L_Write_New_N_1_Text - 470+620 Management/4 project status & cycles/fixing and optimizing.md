
Suppose that you go to bed tonight and sleep well. Sometime, in the
middle of the night, while you are sleeping, a miracle happens and all
the troubles that brought you here are resolved. When you wake up in the
morning, what's the first small sign you'd see that would make you
think, 'Well, something must have happened - the problem is gone!'?" The
Miracle Question doesn't ask you to describe the miracle itself; it asks
you to identify the tangible signs that the miracle happened.

A second question, which is perhaps even more important. The Exception
Question: "When was the last time you saw a little bit of the miracle,
even just for a short time?"
Demonstrate, in a subtle way, is that the client is capable of solving
her own problem. As a matter of fact, the client is offering up proof
that she's already solved it.
Let's replay that scene, where things were working for you. What was
happening? How did you behave?
You are simply asking yourself, "What's working and how can we do more
of it?"

Big problem, small solution. This is a theme you will see again and
again. Big problems are rarely solved with commensurately big solutions.
Instead, they are most often solved by a sequence of small solutions,
sometimes over weeks, sometimes over decades.

"What's working, and how can we do more of it?" Sounds simple, doesn't
it? Yet, in the real world, this obvious question is almost never asked.
Instead, the question we ask is more problem focused: "What's broken,
and how do we fix it?"
