- every NPO wants to be "the" central repository for something

in some ways, NPOs are more vicious, mostly because the scarcity isn't time as much but money
- mismanaged resources may waste a LOT of time, but people can forgive that
- however, the fact that there's less money, and the implication that everyone is performing a [virtuous] task, can cause disenfranchisement WAY faster

The secret to good NPO fundraising involves giving selfish incentives to people
- have a status-enhancing bauble, like heir name on a placard or a collectible trinket that indicates their donorship
- the idea is to appeal to their self-conceit as well as their sense of altruism: they get to be a selfish and good person as a win/win

Nonprofits aren't always isolated from other entities
- they can be a branch of a for-profit organization (e.g., Ronald McDonald Foundation)
- they can HAVE for-profit branches (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Mozilla)
- they can have a board that defines motivations that create secondary benefit to for-profit ventures
- this becomes even more apparent when political activism is involved
- the only way to [stay legally safe] and live [the good life] is to say clearly what the organization's intent is, then do it
