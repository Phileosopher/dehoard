Remote work has pros:
- No rent for office building
- Can recruit a more diverse workforce

Remote work has cons:
- Harder to get everyone on the same page (e.g., conflicts)
- Harder time maintaining morale (they're essentially alone over there MUST MAKE SURE TO HAVE EMERGENCY CONTACT INFO)

remote work is very sticky
It makes sense if there's no good culture to preserve
Tribalknowledge, human interaction etc

Weaker relationships, such as virtual ones, buckle more quickly under
the strain of cultural misundertstandings, and collapse much sooner when
the going gets tough.

Pursue opportunities for virtual interacting:
- hold more virtual meetings that everyone attends
- make sure people identify themselves when they talk on a conference call
- use video-conferencing
- encourage team members to contact each other by phone, not email.
- create a website where you post pictures and personal information
    about team members

the ONLY way to make work-from-home work is to commmunicate in as low-context a style as possible
- this means there's very little room for propriety or politeness
- the natural consequences of this, as well, are that teams will never be as durable long-term, meaning turnover (and training/hiring costs) go up
