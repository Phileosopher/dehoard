As you approach your job each day, ask yourself, "Am I worthy in every
respect of being imitated? Are all my habits such that I would be glad
to see them in my subordinates?"

A great man is one sentence.

At the end of each day, ask yourself whether you were better today than you were yesterday.

Did you learn your ten vocabulary words, make your eight sales calls, eat your five servings of fruits and vegetables, write your four pages?

Give ourselves our own performance reviews. Here's how. Figure out your goals - mostly learning goals, but also a few performance goals - and then every month, call yourself to your office and give yourself an appraisal. How are you faring? Where are you falling short? What tools, information, or support might you need to do better?

When you're newly promoted to manager, MAKE SURE TO ABDICATE SOME OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
- this is especially true for smaller managers and shift supervisors
- you rob the employees of [meaning] when you do their work
- it's great to be an example, but you'll do better to communicate what you want, then get out of the way and hold them accountable to the results
- at the same time, make sure you still do the hard stuff!
