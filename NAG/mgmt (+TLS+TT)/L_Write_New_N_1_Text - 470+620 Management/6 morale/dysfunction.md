Having just one bad apple in a small group can drag down performance by
up to 40 percent.

Great team players change their lifestyle to avoid dysfunctional teams

The most dangerous team dysfunction is in "teams" by name only
- Managers setting goals as opposed to teams setting personal goals to benefit the group
- Team members responsible for only their tasks instead of the team sharing the burden
- Manager assigns tasks to individual members instead of the team as a whole unit
- Most feedback and discussions are solely between the manager and a team member instead of between the members

There are 2 major issues to watch for in censoring bad actors
- Bad originators from leaders
    - This is things like someone making a comment or public expression that doesn't reflect the values of the organization
- Bad responses from followers
    - This is things like comments and smaller discussion that take place IN RESPONSE TO a big statement from a leader
