GROUP:
"That's not my problem" is possibly the worst thing people can think.
Silent disengagement, the consequence of specialized technicians
sticking narrowly to their domains.
We need them to see their job not just as performing their isolated set
of tasks well but also as helping the group get the best possible results.
People who don't know one another's names don't work together nearly as

When you're always online you're always distracted. So the always online
organization is the always unproductive organization.

Asymmetric paternalism. That's a fancy name for a simple idea: creating
policies and incentives that help people triumph over their irrational

As the leader, you ultimately have 100 percent responsibility for everything. When a widget rolls off the line with a broken thingamajig, it's not the fault of the guy who was texting instead of quality-controlling. It's your fault. When a customer is mistreated at a store halfway across the country, don't blame the customer service agent with a bad attitude. You're to blame.

This string is like an army. Push it from behind, and it doubles up on itself - you get nowhere. To drive it forward you have to pull it from the front, and it will follow you in perfect order."

Leadership lesson in preschool, where we learned to walk in a straight line. She walked in front, leading the way, and at every turn she called to us: "Follow me!"

Leadership in the twenty-first century is less about the words that come out of you and more about what exists within you.
