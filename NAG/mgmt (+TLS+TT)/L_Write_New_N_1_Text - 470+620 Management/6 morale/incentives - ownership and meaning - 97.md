people find meaning when they ACTUALLY own things

- Just to point out a demonstrated, viable, successful reality achieved under different values and assumptions, the Mondragon Corporation/cooperative produces car parts, among many other things, and has pre-agreed ratios for wages for executives relative to the lowest wages paid to workers, and this tops out at 9:1. Studies have found that worker-owned coops have a greater survival rate than conventional businesses, and that they have higher productivity.

NOTE: being a manager is a "people" job [with link to AL], so you can't treat others as if they're "soft functions"

Train employees well enough they could get another job, but treat them well enough so they never want to.

You'll get 10x better results by elevating good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior, especially in children and animals.

Always give credit, take blame.

Your group can achieve great things way beyond your means simply by showing people that they are appreciated.

Coaching is named after a vehicle that takes one from here to there.

If you're leading a change effort, you better start looking for those
first two stamps to put on your team's cards. Rather than focusing
solely on what's new and different about the change to come, make an
effort to remind people what's already been conquered.

IDEO: When a team embarks on a new project, team members are filled with
hope and optimism. As they start to collect data and observe real people
struggling with existing products, they find that new ideas spring forth
effortlessly. Then comes the difficult task of integrating all those
fresh ideas into a coherent new design. At this "insight" stage, it's
easy to get depressed, because insight doesn't always strike
immediately. The project often feels like a failure in the middle. But
if the team persists through this valley of angst and doubt, it
eventually emerges with a growing sense of momentum. Team members begin
to test out their new designs, and they realize the improvements they've
made, and they keep tweaking the design to make it better. And they come
to realize, we've cracked this problem. That's when the team reaches the
peak of confidence.

Notice what team leaders at IDEO are doing with the peaks-and-valley
visual: They are creating the expectation of failure. They are telling
team members not to trust that initial flush of good feeling at the
beginning of the project, because what comes next is hardship and toil
and frustration. Yet, strangely enough, when they deliver this warning,
it comes across as optimistic. That's the paradox of the growth mindset.
Although it seems to draw attention to failure, and in fact encourages
us to seek out failure, it is unflaggingly optimistic. We will struggle,
we will fail, we will be knocked down - but throughout, we'll get
better, and we'll succeed in the end. The growth mindset, then, is a
buffer against defeatism. It reframes failure as a natural part of the
change process. And that's critical, because people will persevere only
if they perceive falling down as learning rather than as failing.

The teams who failed made the mistake of trying to "get it right on the
first try" and were motivated by the chance to "perform, to shine, or to
execute perfectly." But of course no one "shines" on the first few tries
- this mindset set the teams up for failure. By contrast, the successful
    teams focused on learning. They didn't assume that mastery would come
    quickly, and they anticipated that they'd face challenges. In the end,
    they were the ones who were more likely to get it right.

Students often didn't do their homework, or they turned in shoddy work.
Getting a D or an F was an easy way out in a way. They might get a poor
grade, but at least they would be done. In the new system, the students
couldn't stop until they'd cleared the bar. "We define up front to the
kids what's an A, B, and C," said Howard. "If they do substandard work,
the teacher will say, 'Not Yet.'"

People have a systematic tendency to ignore the situational forces that
shape other people's behavior. He called this deep-rooted tendency the
"Fundamental Attribution Error." The error lies in our inclination to
attribute people's behavior to the way they are rather than to the
situation they are in.

Some students received a basic letter announcing the launch of a food
drive the following week and asking them to bring canned food to a booth
on Tressider Plaza (a well-known spot on campus). Other students
received a more detailed letter, which included a map to the precise
spot, a request for a can of beans, and a suggestion that they think
about a time when they'd ordinarily be near Tressider Plaza so they
wouldn't have to go out of their way to get there.

Students who received the more detailed letter were substantially more
charitable: 42 percent

Checklists educate people about what's best, showing them the ironclad
right way to do something. (That means that checklists are effective at
directing the Rider.)

People fear checklists because they see them as dehumanizing - maybe
because they associate them with the exhaustive checklists that allow
inexperienced teenagers to operate fast-food chains successfully. They
think if something is simple enough to be put in a checklist, a monkey
can do it. Well, if that's true, grab a pilot's checklist and try your
luck with a 747. Checklists simply make big screwups less likely.

Shamu didn't learn to jump through a hoop because her trainer was
bitching at her. She learned because she had a trainer who was patient
and focused and reinforced every step of the journey.

Cognitive dissonance works in your favor. People don't like to act in
one way and think in another. So once a small step has been taken, and
people have begun to act in a new way, it will be increasingly difficult
for them to dislike the way they're acting. Similarly, as people begin
to act differently, they'll start to think of themselves differently,
and as their identity evolves, it will reinforce the new way of doing
things.

Someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or even a
hundred times as much wealth as an average employee. A programmer, for
example, instead of chugging along maintaining and updating an existing
piece of software, could write a whole new piece of software, and with
it create a new source of revenue. Companies are not set up to reward
people who want to do this.

A company that could pay all its employees straightforwardly would be
enormously successful. Many employees would work harder if they could
get paid for it. More importantly, such a company would attract people
who wanted to work especially hard. It would crush its competitors.
Unfortunately, companies can't pay everyone like salesmen. Salesmen work
alone. Most employees' work is tangled together.

Limit the amount of people who have access to the boss.
Gatekeepers: no more drop-ins, tidbits, and stray reports.
So the boss can see the big picture.
So the boss has time and room to think.
Because if the boss doesn't, then nobody can.

Who ultimately is going to receive the end result brought about by the
choice that is made?
You must not intervene in others' tasks.
Help them in those decisions.

Successful entrepreneurs possess perseverance and leadership skills, of
course. What is less obvious - and much less boring - is what the
speaker neglected to mention: that those traits are likely to be the
characteristics of extremely unsuccessful people, too.

You cannot inspire others to sell more when that goal is inconsistent
with your own conduct.

Giving monkeys raisins as a reward for each correct step in solving a
puzzle (such as opening a mechanical latch with several moving parts)
actually interferes with the solving, because it distracts the monkeys.
They enjoy the task for its own sake.

When money is used as an external reward for some activity, the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity.

Human beings have an inherent tendency to seek out novelty and challenges, to extend and exercise their capacities, to explore, and to learn. But this third drive was more fragile than the other two; it needed the right environment to survive.

One who is interested in developing and enhancing intrinsic motivation in children, employees, students, etc., should not concentrate on external-control systems such as monetary rewards.

For too long, there's been a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.

The Motivation 2.0 operating system has endured for a very long time. Indeed, it is so deeply embedded in our lives that most of us scarcely recognize that it exists. For as long as any of us can remember, we've configured our organizations and constructed our lives around its bedrock assumption: The way to improve performance, increase productivity, and encourage excellence is to reward the good and punish the bad.

People in the open-source movement haven't taken vows of poverty. For many, participation in these projects can burnish their reputations and sharpen their skills, which can enhance their earning power.

Lakhani and Wolf uncovered a range of motives, but they found that enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver.

The fun of mastering the challenge of a given software problem and the desire to give a gift to the programmer community.

Muhammad Yunus has begun creating what he calls "social businesses." These are companies that raise capital, develop products, and sell them in an open market but do so in the service of a larger social mission - or as he puts it, "with the profit-maximization principle replaced by the social-benefit principle."

"For benefit" organizations, B corporations, and low-profit limited-liability corporations all recast the goals of the traditional business enterprise.

Economics isn't the study of money. It is the study of behavior. In the course of a day, each of us was constantly figuring the cost and benefits of our actions and then deciding how to act. Economists studied what people did, rather than what we said.

An algorithmic task is one in which you follow a set of established instructions down a single pathway to one conclusion. That is, there's an algorithm for solving it. A heuristic task is the opposite. Precisely because no algorithm exists for it, you have to experiment with possibilities and devise a novel solution.

People are much more likely to report having "optimal experiences" on the job than during leisure.

Vocation Vacations. This is a business in which people pay their hard-earned money to work at another job. They use their vacation time to test-drive being a chef, running a bike shop, or operating an animal shelter.

America alone now has more than 18 million of what the U.S. Census Bureau calls "non-employer businesses" - businesses without any paid employees.

Only contingent rewards - if you do this, then you'll get that - had the negative effect. Why? "If-then" rewards require people to forfeit some of their autonomy.

Rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus. That's helpful when there's a clear path to a solution. They help us stare ahead and race faster.

The less evidence of extrinsic motivation during art school, the more success in professional art both several years after graduation and nearly twenty years later.

Painters and sculptors who were intrinsically motivated, those for whom the joy of discovery and the challenge of creation were their own rewards, were able to weather the tough times - and the lack of remuneration and recognition - that inevitably accompany artistic careers.

Those artists who pursued their painting and sculpture more for the pleasure of the activity itself than for extrinsic rewards have produced art that has been socially recognized as superior. It is those who are least motivated to pursue extrinsic rewards who eventually receive them.

Goals that people set for themselves and that are devoted to attaining mastery are usually healthy. But goals imposed by others - sales targets, quarterly returns, standardized test scores, and so on - can sometimes have dangerous side effects. Like all extrinsic motivators, goals narrow our focus. That's one reason they can be effective; they concentrate the mind. But as we've seen, a narrowed focus exacts a cost. For complex or conceptual tasks, offering a reward can blinker the wide-ranging thinking necessary to come up with an innovative solution. Likewise, when an extrinsic goal is paramount - particularly a short-term, measurable one whose achievement delivers a big payoff - its presence can restrict our view of the broader dimensions of our behavior.

The problem with making an extrinsic reward the only destination that matters is that some people will choose the quickest route there, even if it means taking the low road.

By offering a reward, a principal signals to the agent that the task is undesirable.

In environments where extrinsic rewards are most salient, many people work only to the point that triggers the reward - and no further.

When the artists considered their commissions "enabling" - that is, the commission enabled the artist to do something interesting or exciting - the creativity ranking of what they produced shot back up. The same was true for commissions the artists felt provided them with useful information and feedback about their ability.

Any extrinsic reward should be unexpected and offered only after the task is complete. Holding out a prize at the beginning of a project - and offering it as a contingency - will inevitably focus people's attention on obtaining the reward rather than on attacking the problem.

Deci and Ryan have fashioned what they call self-determination theory.

We have three innate psychological needs - competence, autonomy, and relatedness. When those needs are satisfied, we're motivated, productive, and happy. When they're thwarted, our motivation, productivity, and happiness plummet.

When people use rewards to motivate, that's when they're most demotivating. Instead, Deci and Ryan say we should focus our efforts on creating environments for our innate psychological needs to flourish.

Hundreds of research papers point to the same conclusion. Human beings have an innate inner drive to be autonomous, self-determined, and connected to one another. And when that drive is liberated, people achieve more and live richer lives.

The Type B person may also have a considerable amount of drive, but its character is such that it seems to steady him, give confidence and security to him, rather than to goad, irritate, and infuriate, as with the Type A man.

Taking an interest in work is as natural as play or rest, that creativity and ingenuity were widely distributed in the population, and that under the proper conditions, people will accept, and even seek, responsibility.

Intrinsically motivated people usually achieve more than their reward-seeking counterparts. Alas, that's not always true in the short term. An intense focus on extrinsic rewards can indeed deliver fast results. The trouble is, this approach is difficult to sustain. And it doesn't assist in mastery - which is the source of achievement over the long haul. The most successful people, the evidence shows, often aren't directly pursuing conventional notions of success. They're working hard and persisting through difficulties because of their internal desire to control their lives, learn about their world, and accomplish something that endures.

People oriented toward autonomy and intrinsic motivation have higher self-esteem, better interpersonal relationships, and greater general well-being than those who are extrinsically motivated. By contrast, people whose core aspirations are Type X validations such as money, fame, or beauty tend to have poorer psychological health.

Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose.

People still had specific goals they had to reach - for example, completing a project by a certain time or ringing up a particular number of sales. And if they needed help, the manager was there to assist. But he decided against tying those goals to compensation. "That creates a culture that says it's all about the money and not enough about the work." Money, he believes, is only "a threshold motivator."

The idea of management (that is, management of people rather than management of, say, supply chains) is built on certain assumptions about the basic natures of those being managed. It presumes that to take action or move forward, we need a prod - that absent a reward or punishment, we'd remain happily and inertly in place. It also presumes that once people do get moving, they need direction - that without a firm and reliable guide, they'd wander. But is that really our fundamental nature? Or, to use yet another computer metaphor, is that our "default setting"? When we enter the world, are we wired to be passive and inert? Or are we wired to be active and engaged?

Perhaps management is one of the forces that's switching our default setting and producing that state.

Resist the temptation to control people - and instead do everything we can to reawaken their deep-seated sense of autonomy.

Autonomy, as they see it, is different from independence. It's not the rugged, go-it-alone, rely-on-nobody individualism of the American cowboy. It means acting with choice - which means we can be both autonomous and happily interdependent with others. And while the idea of independence has national and political reverberations, autonomy appears to be a human concept rather than a western one.

A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude. According to a cluster of recent behavioral science studies, autonomous motivation promotes greater conceptual understanding, better grades, enhanced persistence at school and in sporting activities, higher productivity, less burnout, and greater levels of psychological well-being.

Researchers at Cornell University studied 320 small businesses, half of which granted workers autonomy, the other half relying on top-down direction. The businesses that offered autonomy grew at four times the rate of the control-oriented firms and had one-third the turnover.

"As an entrepreneur, I'm blessed with 100% autonomy over task, time, technique and team. Here's the thing: If I maintain that autonomy, I fail. I fail to ship. I fail to excel. I fail to focus. I inevitably end up either with no product or a product the market rejects. The art of the art is picking your limits. That's the autonomy I most cherish. The freedom to pick my boundaries." - SETH GODIN

Homeshoring: Instead of requiring customer service reps to report to a single large call center, they're routing the calls to the employees' homes. This cuts commuting time for staff, removes them from physical monitoring, and provides far greater autonomy over how they do their jobs. (JetBlue)

Human history has always moved in the direction of greater freedom. And there's a reason for that - because it's in our nature to push for it.

Mastery: the desire to get better and better at something that matters.

"Throughout my athletics career, the overall goal was always to be a better athlete than I was at that moment - whether next week, next month or next year. The improvement was the goal. The medal was simply the ultimate reward for achieving that goal."   SEBASTIAN COE Middle-distance runner and two-time Olympic gold medal winner

In flow, the relationship between what a person had to do and what he could do was perfect. The challenge wasn't too easy. Nor was it too difficult. It was a notch or two beyond his current abilities, which stretched the body and mind in a way that made the effort itself the most delicious reward. That balance produced a degree of focus and satisfaction.

Instead of meeting with their charges for once-a-year performance reviews, managers sat down with employees one-on-one six times a year, often for as long as ninety minutes, to discuss their level of engagement and path toward mastery.

Jenova Chen, a young game designer who, in 2006, wrote his MFA thesis on Csikszentmihalyi's theory. Chen believed that video games held the promise to deliver quintessential flow experiences. While most games require players to proceed through a fixed and predetermined series of skill levels, Chen's allows them to advance and explore any way they desire. And unlike games in which failure ends the session, in Chen's game failure merely pushes the player to a level better matched to her ability. Chen calls his game flOw.

If people are conscious of what puts them in flow, they'll have a clearer idea of what they should devote the time and dedication to master.

Effort is one of the things that gives meaning to life. Effort means you care about something, that something is important to you and you are willing to work for it.

Mastery is an asymptote.

Why reach for something you can never fully attain? But it's also a source of allure. Why not reach for it? The joy is in the pursuit more than the realization. In the end, mastery attracts precisely because mastery eludes.

Pursue purpose - and use profit as the catalyst rather than the objective.

Imagine an organization, for example, that believes in affirmative action - one that wants to make the world a better place by creating a more diverse workforce. By reducing ethics to a checklist, suddenly affirmative action is just a bunch of requirements that the organization must meet to show that it isn't discriminating. Now the organization isn't focused on affirmatively pursuing diversity but rather on making sure that all the boxes are checked off to show that what it did is OK (and so it won't get sued). Before, its workers had an intrinsic motivation to do the right thing, but now they have an extrinsic motivation to make sure that the company doesn't get sued or fined.

They're busy making money and attending to themselves and that means that there's less room in their lives for love and attention and caring and empathy and the things that truly count," Ryan added. And if the broad contours of these findings are true for individuals, why shouldn't they also be true for organizations - which, of course, are collections of individuals?

A healthy society - and healthy business organizations - begins with purpose and considers profit a way to move toward that end or a happy by-product of its attainment.

Collins suggests four basic practices for creating a culture where self-motivation can flourish:
1. Lead with questions, not answers
2. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion
3. Conduct autopsies, without blame
4. Build 'red flag' mechanisms
In other words, make it easy for employees and customers to speak up when they identify a problem. More Info: Collins's website: jimcollins.com

Mark Vidler, Go Home Productions: "You don't need a distributor, because your distribution is the internet. You don't need a record label, because it's your bedroom. You don't need a recording studio, because that's your computer. You do it all yourself."

Even small option grants seem to instill a sense of ownership, and we know that owners are, in general, more likely to take good care of their property than renters are.

Far more important than stock options would be the elimination of rigid managerial hierarchies and the wider distribution of real decision-making power.

The more responsibilty people have for their own environments the more engaged they will be.

Allowing people to make decisions about their own working conditions makes a material difference in how they perform.

"Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy
of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort." - Franklin D. Roosevelt

A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two
things keep the speed of the galley down. One is that individual rowers
don't see any result from working harder. The other is that, in a group
of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average.
If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and put them in a
boat by themselves, they could probably go faster. When you take the ten
best rowers out of the big galley and put them in a boat together. They
will have all the extra motivation that comes from being in a small
group. But more importantly, by selecting that small a group you can get
the best rowers. Each one will be in the top 1%. It's a much better deal
for them to average their work together with a small group of their
peers than to average it with everyone. That's the real point of
startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a group of other people
who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they
would in a big company.

If your team is filled with people who work for the company, you'll soon be defeated by tribes of people who work for a cause.

It's the bridges between people that generate value.

The time their employees spend with customers (and the loyalty and enthusiasm it generates) creates more value than does the machine in the factory.
