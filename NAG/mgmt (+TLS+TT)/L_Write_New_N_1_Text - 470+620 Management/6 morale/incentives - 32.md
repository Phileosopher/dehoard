Craft bonuses for those who work for you to achieve margin, cost, and revenue targets.

You won't get far if you attempt to financially "incentivize" the salt of the earth. (The types that just enjoy working hard.) Praise, the ability to discern when a good job has been done, and the courtesy to say so, fairness, integrity, and camraderie should be employed instead. It takes more trouble than mere bribery, but it produces wonderful results.

Ways to make more pie:
- Make annual bonuses generous
- "ring fence" investment costs from ongoing business : investment money for new projects taken out of ongoing business as a real expense
- never delegate bonus arrangements.
- at senior level, insist on collective responsibility for bonuses
- praise excellent work
- fire poor workers mercilessly
- turn a cold eye to company perks
- avoid all "jollies" : trips to Hawaii
- set an example : don't waste company money
- have senior managers go over annual results with you one-on-one : their comments can be priceless
- back up your managers
- seek out and promote talent
- interview your rivals' talent
- discourage secrecy
- save a little bit of pie for suppliers
- never bad-mouth rivals
- sell early (real money rarely comes from horsing around running an asset-laden business if you're an entrepreneur. you're not a manager, remember? whenever the chance comes to sell an asset at the top of its value, do so. things do not keep increasing in value forever. get out while the going is good and move on to the next venture.)
- enjoy the business of making money

Deliberately employ men and women who are smarter than you - and listen to them.

by the time you've gotten to a formalized system, the informal system broke
- performance improvement plans are designed for the protection of the organization and management, in the off-chance they get sued (so they can be fired with cause)
- therefore, be VERY CLEAR what measurements you're using, and be VERY THOROUGH AND PRECISE recording those measurements

Offering to increase pay for teachers if the academic achievement of
their students improved had no effect on student performance. Giving
teachers the same amount of money at the beginning of the term and
telling them they would have to pay back that amount if their students
failed to meet a specified target resulted in a significant positive
effect on student performance.

Children who got the award after having contracted to draw with the
markers in order to win it drew with the markers less than half as much
as children who got an unanticipated award or no reward at all. The
young contractors realized that drawing with the markers was something
they did in order to get something they wanted. The other children could
only infer that they were drawing with the markers because they wanted to.

In short-term thinking, following the rules, rewarding someone who has
done it before
is a great way to win. Long-term, though, all you've done is taught
conformity and punished initiation. You can't optimize your way to
surprising growth.

Cravings are what drive habits. And figuring out how to spark a craving
makes creating a new habit easier.

Rewards can deliver a short-term boost - just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few more hours. But the effect wears off - and, worse, can reduce a person's longer-term motivation to continue the project.

People have to earn a living. Salary, contract payments, some benefits, a few perks are what I call "baseline rewards." If someone's baseline rewards aren't adequate or equitable, her focus will be on the unfairness of her situation and the anxiety of her circumstance. You'll get neither the predictability of extrinsic motivation nor the weirdness of intrinsic motivation. You'll get very little motivation at all. But once we're past that threshold, carrots and sticks can achieve precisely the opposite of their intended aims. Mechanisms designed to increase motivation can dampen it. Tactics aimed at boosting creativity can reduce it. Programs to promote good deeds can make them disappear. Meanwhile, instead of restraining negative behavior, rewards and punishments can often set it loose - and give rise to cheating, addiction, and dangerously myopic thinking.

A key motivational principle: "Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do. Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do."

There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.

CARROTS AND STICKS: The Seven Deadly Flaws
1. They can extinguish intrinsic motivation.
2. They can diminish performance.
3. They can crush creativity.
4. They can crowd out good behavior.
5. They can encourage cheating, shortcuts, and unethical behavior.
6. They can become addictive.
7. They can foster short-term thinking.

Ensure that the baseline rewards - wages, salaries, benefits, and so on - are adequate and fair. Without a healthy baseline, motivation of any sort is difficult and often impossible.

Rewards do not undermine people's intrinsic motivation for dull tasks because there is little or no intrinsic motivation to be undermined.

For some people, much of what they do all day consists of these routine, not terribly captivating, tasks. In these situations, it's best to try to unleash the positive side of the Sawyer Effect by attempting to turn work into play - to increase the task's variety, to make it more like a game, or to use it to help master other skills.

Your best approach is to have already established the conditions of a genuinely motivating environment. The baseline rewards must be sufficient. That is, the team's basic compensation must be adequate and fair - particularly compared with people doing similar work for similar organizations. Your nonprofit must be a congenial place to work. And the people on your team must have autonomy, they must have ample opportunity to pursue mastery, and their daily duties must relate to a larger purpose. If these elements are in place, the best strategy is to provide a sense of urgency and significance - and then get out of the talent's way.

In a Results-Only Work Environment (ROWE) workplace, people don't have schedules. They show up when they want. They don't have to be in the office at a certain time - or any time, for that matter. They just have to get their work done. How they do it, when they do it, and where they do it is up to them.

Those who did the best typically spent the most time and effort on the mundane activities.

If someone is bored with his current assignment, see if he can train someone else in the skills he's already mastered. Then see if he can take on some aspect of a more experienced team member's work.

Get compensation right - and then get it out of sight. Effective organizations compensate people in amounts and in ways that allow individuals to mostly forget about compensation and instead focus on the work itself.

The most important aspect of any compensation package is fairness. And here, fairness comes in two varieties - internal and external. Internal fairness means paying people commensurate with their colleagues. External fairness means paying people in line with others doing similar work in similar organizations.

Paying great people a little more than the market demands, Akerlof and Yellen found, could attract better talent, reduce turnover, and boost productivity and morale.

The pay-more-than-average approach can offer an elegant way to bypass "if-then" rewards, eliminate concerns about unfairness, and help take the issue of money off the table.

Providing an employee a high level of base pay does more to boost performance and organizational commitment than an attractive bonus structure.

Imagine you're a product manager and your pay is determined by these factors:
your sales for the next quarter
your sales in the current year
the company's revenue and profit in the next two years
levels of satisfaction among your customers
ideas for new products
and evaluations of your coworkers.
If you're smart, you'll probably try to sell your product, serve your customers, help your teammates, and, well, do good work. When metrics are varied, they're harder to finagle. In addition, the gain for reaching the metrics shouldn't be too large. When the payoff for reaching targets is modest, rather than massive, it's less likely to narrow people's focus or encourage them to take the low road.

People at all levels stop doing any activity that is a waste of their time, the customer's time, or their company's time. 

Start giving gifts that change people.

Reward the achievers. Serve notice to everyone that "this person delivered".

People respond to incentives. If you give them more of a reason to do something, they will do more of it, and if you make it easier to do more of something they are already inclined to do, they will also do more of it.
