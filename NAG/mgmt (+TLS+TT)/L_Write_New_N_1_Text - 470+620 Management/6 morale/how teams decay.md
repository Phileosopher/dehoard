
Team dysfunction decays through five stages
A. Absence of trust
- Unwilling to admit mistakes, weaknesses or the need for help
- Comes from a refusal to expose any vulnerability to one another
B. Fear of conflict
- Fear of engaging in unfiltered and passionate debate over critical issues
- Comes from strong distrust and causes team conflicts through veiled discussions and implicating comments
C. Lack of commitment
- Unwilling to agree to anything without a conflict
- Creates significant ambiguity which disgruntles employees, especially the best employees
D. Avoiding accountability
- Nobody is held responsible
- Unfulfilled promises create an unclear plan of action
- Everyone becomes hesitant to call out counterproductive behaviors
E. No more focus on results
- The group no longer sees a need to achieve
- Without accountability, members will naturally place personal interests over the team's needs
- Since the group no longer desires success, it inevitably fails

Business owners will always have issues with their support staff as long as they don't feel truly fulfilled by their work, no matter what perks the employer gives them.

You (the business owner) are working for the person (employee) who asks, "What can you do for me today?"

A team full of people resenting the team leader is no team at all.

Companies do things. They are tools designed for a particular purpose - or they should be. If they are superseded, or surplus to requirement, we shed them. We try our level best not to shed the people, or the know-how, but the company itself is not something we allow ourselves to get too nostalgic about.

You learn very quickly not to skimp on the goodwill gestures. They let people know that, whatever the difficulty, you're still working for them.

Young, independently minded businesses can provide customers with great service: it's the monoliths and the business establishment that make customers' lives a misery.
