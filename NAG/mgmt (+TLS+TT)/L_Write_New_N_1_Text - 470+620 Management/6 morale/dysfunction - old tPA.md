
#### Not everyone likes working in a great organization

They must like others' expectations that they seek accomplishment
They have to adapt to the established culture
They need to feel proud to be part of that organization
They have to take an interest in changing everything about their work
They must value clear, open, and honest communication

#### Great members of dysfunctional cultures must do one of a few things

1. Work twice as hard through the necessary bureaucracy to come to the important part of the work
2. Ignore and break completely arbitrary rules they fully know nobody checks and nobody cares about
3. Compromise their values and become part of the problem
4. Leave the system and find a better environment
