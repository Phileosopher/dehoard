
### Socially engineer your organization

Set rules that support or discourage certain large-scale behaviors

#### Most organizations correct their course with two methods

A. Placing many rules to follow precisely to avoid mistakes
- People usually find ways to honor rules while still doing a terrible job
- Formalized systems often make potentially devoted members disloyal from a lack of distinguishing other positive qualities (e.g., reprimand for a late delivery without considering the circumstances)

B. Giving incentives to make people want great results
- People usually find ways to game the system and invalidate the incentive's purpose
- Over time, the focus can become distorted into a completely arbitrary set of rules which don't produce results
- If you decide not to have incentives, make sure everyone knows precisely why

The only long-term cure for lousy performance is a virtue-based culture
- Practical wisdom is both the moral skill to learn what the right thing is and the moral will to do it
- Wise people know particular instances for when and how the rules don't apply
