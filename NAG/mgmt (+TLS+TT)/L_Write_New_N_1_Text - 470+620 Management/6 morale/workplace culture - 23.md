
In an ideal business environment, everybody should have a rough idea of what everyone else is going through. People should be free to talk. Banter is essential.

Put people together in a way that will have them bouncing ideas off each other, befriending each other, and taking care of each other.

We try as far as we can to make people feel as if they are working for their own company. Our more senior people have share stakes or options in the companies they run.

Someone described Virgin as an 'unprofessional professional organisation', which for my money is just about the best backhanded compliment anyone in business could ever receive. We run our companies professionally and we make sure that everyone does their job to the highest standards. But the way we make sure is to see that people are having fun. Fun is not about acting stupid. It's the feeling you get when you're on top of things. We try to make sure that the people who come into contact with a Virgin business end up with a smile on their face (not always easy).

It's about turning what excites you in life into capital, so that you can do more of it and move forward with it. I think entrepreneurship is our natural state - a big adult word that probably boils down to something much more obvious like 'playfulness'.

Inspire your people to think like entrepreneurs, and whatever you do, treat them like adults. The hardest taskmaster of all is a person's own conscience, so the more responsibility you give people, the better they will work for you.

The more you free your people to think for themselves, the more they can help you. You don't have to do this all on your own.

We didn't need cross-holdings, or strong family structures: we had a flag. The bonding power of the Virgin brand has permitted us to take the bold decision to give everyone the opportunity to be entrepreneurs in their own right. It is a flag to which all members of our extended family pay due respect. They enjoy the advantages of doing business under the Virgin umbrella, and in return they agree to protect the integrity of the brand. If they don't, then we can legally withdraw the name. Everybody fights for their own particular Virgin company - and shares in the upside when things go well.

I now have a team of people who meet once a week to go through every Virgin company, looking at figures, projections and income. They have a list of priorities, and a list of new projects. They make sure that the Virgin Group is running efficiently. This frees me up to dive in and out when necessary.

Jack Welch encouraged managers to start each day as if it was the first day in the job. He said that managers were often afraid of change - and they must embrace it.

Success turns not on being the low-price leader but on being the high-trust leader.

What matters now:
Trust
Permission
Remarkability
Leadership
Stories that spread
Humanity: connection, compassion, and humility
And here's the thing: All six of these are the result of successful work by artists.

Leadership puts the leader on the line.

If you ask someone for the rule book on how to lead, you're secretly wishing to be a manager. Leaders are vulnerable, not controlling, and they are taking us to a new place.

We seek out human originality and caring.

What we are drawn to is the vulnerability and transparency that bring us together.

Our revolution is turning most business into show business.

when they move from task to show, they are adding far more value than ever before.

Connection requires emotional labor: a little more emotional labor is often worth a lot.

The race to the bottom is lower prices, find cheaper labor.
The other race is the race to the top, the opportunity to be the one they can't live without.

Delivering more for more.

It's not what you've got; it's how brave you're prepared to be.

(2021) Be a better coworker
> Organization. Don't lose crap, ever. Passwords, dates, files, emails, notes, links, whatever.
> Responsiveness. Be easy to reach and quick to respond (but protect your focused deep work time).
> Reliability. If you said you'll do it, then freaking do it, no matter how tiny it is. People notice.
> Warmth. Maybe you can't be funny or charming, but you can be warm.
