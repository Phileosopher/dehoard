Notice how many times people have tweaked the environment to shape your
behavior.
Example: Robby and Kent who frequently arrive late and then sit in the
back of the room:
Shape the Path.
1. Tweak the environment. Lock the door when the bell rings so
    latecomers are stuck in the hallway.
2. Build habits. Start having a daily quiz with one or two quick
    questions at the beginning of every class. If Robby and Kent aren't
    present to take the quiz, they'll fail.
3. Rally the herd. Post a class "on-time" record on the wall. Maybe when
    Robby and Kent see that they're the only students violating the social
    norm to be on time, they'll change their ways.
4. Build habits. Set a policy that the last student in his or her seat
    every day will be asked to answer the first question.
5. Rally the herd. Find a way to let Robby and Kent know that the other
    students dislike what they're doing (as they almost certainly do). Often
    troublemakers have the illusion that their defiant behavior makes them
    folk heroes. They can be deflated quickly by frank peer feedback.
6. Tweak the environment. Do what Bart Millar actually did: He bought a
    used couch and put it right at the front of the classroom. It was
    immediately obvious that this couch was the cool place to sit - students
    could slouch and relax instead of sitting at a dorky desk. Suddenly
    Robby and Kent started getting to class early every day so they could
    "get a good seat." They were volunteering to sit at the front of the
    classroom. Genius.
Leaders had to reshape the Path consciously. With some simple tweaks to
the environment, suddenly the right behaviors emerged. It wasn't the
people who changed; it was the situation. What looks like a people
problem is often a situation problem.

Design an environment in which undesired behaviors are made not only
harder but impossible.

HADDON MATRIX: In trying to minimize the risk of bad outcomes, injury-prevention
experts often turn to the Haddon Matrix, a simple framework that
provides a way to think systematically about accidents by highlighting
three key periods of time: pre-event, event, and post-event.

Rackspace example: When the call-queuing system was thrown out, the
customer-service staffers quickly developed the habit of answering the
phone.

Action triggers can have a profound power to motivate people to do the
things they know they need to do. Peter Gollwitzer argues that the value
of action triggers resides in the fact that we are preloading a
decision. Dropping off Anna at school triggers the next action, going to
the gym. There's no cycle of conscious deliberation. By preloading the
decision, we conserve the Rider's self-control.

When people predecide, they "pass the control of their behavior on to
the environment." Gollwitzer says that action triggers "protect goals
from tempting distractions, bad habits, or competing goals."

Habits are behavioral autopilot, and that's why they're such a critical
tool for leaders. Leaders who can instill habits that reinforce their
teams' goals are essentially making progress for free. They've changed
behavior in a way that doesn't draw down the Rider's reserves of
self-control.

Habits will form inevitably, whether they're formed intentionally or
not. You've probably created lots of team habits unwittingly. If your
staff meetings always start out with genial small talk, then you've
created a habit. You've designed your meeting autopilot to yield a few
minutes of warm-up small talk. The hard question for a leader is not how
to form habits but which habits to encourage.

A good change leader never thinks, "Why are these people acting so
badly? They must be bad people."
A change leader thinks, "How can I set up a situation that brings out
the good in these people?"

A self-disciplined employee will have the patience to conduct routine business routinely, the talent to respond exceptionally to exceptional circumstances, and the wisdom to know the difference.

Delivery is never rocket science. When we move from sector to sector, I'd say about 90 per cent of our core delivery strategy comes with us and slots straight in, without adjustment, without fuss, without trouble. Getting to grips with an unfamiliar infrastructure is simply a question of workload - of mastering detail.

The team had a real sense of autonomy. I didn't need to be involved day-to-day, but I was sent regular information and figures, which I looked at each night. From the off, the business acted like a listed company - and that's how all start-ups should try to behave.

Engage your emotions at work. Your instincts and emotions are there to help you. They are there to make things easier. For me, business is a 'gut feeling', and if it ever ceased to be so, I think I would give it up tomorrow. By 'gut feeling', I mean that I believe I've developed a natural aptitude, tempered by huge amounts of experience, that tends to point me in the right direction.
