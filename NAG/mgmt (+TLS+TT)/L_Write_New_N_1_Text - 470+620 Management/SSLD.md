SSLD uses N3C:
    needs
    circumstances
    characteristics
    capacity
it defines problems and challenges in life in terms of human needs

before anything else, we have to ask: why do people even have relationships in the first place?
- we have relationships based on needs, which come in 4 different levels
    Physical
        Food
        Water
        Shelter
        Safety
        All things we experienced as infants
    Psychological/Interpersonal
        Security
        Attachment
        Affiliation
        Intimacy
    Social
        Sense of Identity
        Social Position
        Status
        Access to resources and opportunities in our social world
    Existential/Spiritual
        Purpose
        Sense of Being
        Union with the universe
we ask "what are my needs?", but not everyone understands their needs very clearly
we often have wants that are confused as needs
Needs can be intrinsic or extrinsic
    Intrinsic - we value the relationship for its own sake
        Affiliation
        Attachment
        Intimacy
    Extrinsic - we have a secondary purpose for the relationship
        Personal
        Instrumental
feedback from relationships heavily impact who we are

SSLD uses strategies and skills
    strategies are sequences of actions aimed at achieving a particular goal
    skills are something you can do well to achieve a particular task
    it is basically a "post-professional era" tool, meant to draw from more than one specialization to achieve goals
it breaks into a method
    1. identifies the problem translation
        problems come from unmet needs, which can be met with better goals
    2. taking action through SSLD
        adds SSLD to help with the goals
    3. beyond problem solving
