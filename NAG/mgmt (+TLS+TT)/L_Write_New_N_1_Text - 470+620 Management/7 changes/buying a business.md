When an owner auctions off his business, exhibiting a total lack of interest in what follows, you will frequently find that it has been dressed up for sale. If owners behave with little regard for their business, their conduct will often contaminate attitudes and practices throughout the company.

HOW TO EVALUATE BUSINESSES:
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
1. How certain are you that there are birds in the bush?
2. When will they emerge and how many will there be?
3. What is the risk-free interest rate (yield on long-term bonds)?
Answer these three questions, and you'll know the maximum value of the bush - and the maximum number of birds that should be offered for it.
This applies to outlays for farms, oil royalties, bonds, stocks, lottery tickets, and manufacturing plants.
Just insert the correct numbers, and you can rank the attractiveness of all possible uses of capital throughout the universe.
