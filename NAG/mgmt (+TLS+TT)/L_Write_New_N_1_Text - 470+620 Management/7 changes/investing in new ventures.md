
We receive hundreds of business ideas every month, often directly via our website. We employ a gatekeeper - a corporate development assistant - whose job it is to record, log and classify all ideas as they arrive. She then passes them on to our experts. They read through and research the best of them. A tiny number are passed to our investment professionals - whole teams of them. So that our own vested interests don't blind us to new opportunities, none of the committee runs a Virgin business on a day-to-day basis. They ask some very tough questions. They will rigorously push and pull your business plan about to see if there is a profitable business underneath.

We look at spending plans, income forecasts, the marketing budget, and when the company is likely to break even. We work out our exit strategy - will it be a sale, or a flotation on a stock market? And, above all, we look at the key managers who will be running the business. This is the holy grail for us, because it's the people that make a great business idea work.

We sign up as branded venture capitalists (occasionally, as unbranded investors), take a stake in the company, and then look for a return on that investment after about two to five years.

A basic understanding of the business, gleaned by immersing yourself in every little detail for months or even weeks, is often enough to get you started. The volume of information you'll need to hack through will be high - so find some friends to help you - but the underlying business model is always fairly simple.

When you're first thinking through an idea, it's important not to get bogged down in complexity. Thinking simply and clearly is hard to do. It takes concentration and practice and self-discipline.

My plans acquire detail as I test them against questions that on the face of it are really quite simple - and more to do with emotions than figures. If we create the best health club in town, will existing gym users go to all the bother of transferring their membership to us?

Virgin's business aim has been to find a strong position in a game-changing market.

We put ourselves out there, searching for new opportunities. And we know that they are more likely to come our way if we get ahead of ourselves and prepare the ground first.

Virgin's normal rate of return in business is around 30 per cent.
