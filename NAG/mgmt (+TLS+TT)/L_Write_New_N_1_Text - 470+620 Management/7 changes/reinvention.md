
Reinventing the business design by using customer-centric and profit-centric principles has great rewards. Customers return. Profits grow. Employee morale rebounds.

Reinvention is about the customer and profitability, but ultimately it is about creativity, about designing a business model that is unique. Perhaps the most important benefit of studying any reinventors and how they discover or create the profit zone in their industries is grasping how the creative process works in business (how business designs change every 5 years), what discipline (in customer and profit thinking) it requires, and how extraordinary its outcomes can be.

Business design innovation drives financial improvement, which drives increased valuation, which drives value growth.

Business design innovation requires major nonincremental moves. Making such moves inevitably leads to major errors.

Be on the lookout for what the next metrics revolution will be.

Understanding the fundamentals of business design innovation is perhaps the best preparation for an uncertain future.
