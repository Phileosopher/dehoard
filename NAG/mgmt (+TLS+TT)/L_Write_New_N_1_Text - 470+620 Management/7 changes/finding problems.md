
Use a system called the Five Whys to make incremental investments and evolve a startup's processes gradually. The core idea of Five Whys is to tie investments directly to the prevention of the most problematic symptoms. The system takes its name from the investigative method of asking the question "Why?" five times to understand what has happened (the root cause).

At the root of every seemingly technical problem is a human problem. Five Whys provides an opportunity to discover what that human problem might be.

Chronic problems are caused by bad process, not bad people, and remedy them accordingly.

Managers and employees can fall into the trap of using the Five Blames as a means for venting their frustrations and calling out colleagues for systemic failures.

We routinely asked new engineers to make a change to the production environment on their first day.

"If our production process is so fragile that you can break it on your very first day of work, shame on us for making it so easy to do so."

Everyone came through it with a visceral understanding of our values.

Ask teams to adopt these simple rules:
1. Be tolerant of all mistakes the first time.
2. Never allow the same mistake to be made twice.

There are problems waiting to be solved, once you realize that you have all the tools and all the permission you need, then opportunities to contribute abound.
