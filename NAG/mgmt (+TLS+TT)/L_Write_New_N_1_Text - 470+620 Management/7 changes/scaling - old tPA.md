
### Every organization grows through a life cycle

The larger the organization grows, the less hands-on and responsive the leader's role becomes
Changes are always definite and clear in large organizations
1. The situation is "unfrozen" from its static format by reducing certain requirements
2. A social movement arises with some confusion and inefficiency as everyone adjusts to a new way of doing things
    - These changes must come from an open system which combines internal feedback and external signals
3. New standards are "frozen" as everyone agrees to the new changes

Each organization travels through four periods
1. Formation period - a new organization started, a founding vision without formal definitions
2. Rapid growth period - organization adds direction and coordination to keep growing and ensuring success
3. Mature period - growth slows to match the pace of the industry
4. Declining period - often involves laying off workers and reorganizing
5. Successful reorganization creates a new Formation period
