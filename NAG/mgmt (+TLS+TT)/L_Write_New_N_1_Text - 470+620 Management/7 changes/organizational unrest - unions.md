
unions are inevitable if the workers are feeling mistreated
- the situation has effectively become so bad that everyone would rather pile their work together and get measured on an arbitrary "hours/days of service" metric than be measured on their individual achievements
- they distrust their employer so badly that they are more open to trusting a union rep than the person who cuts their check
- it's the combination of having a significant portion of lousy workers, mixed with bad management, mixed with bad pay structures
- if an organization even has talks of unionizing, it's time for the management to do some severe soul-searching
