
George Soros knew how to handle randomness by keeping a critical open mind and changing his opinions with minimal shame. (Which carries the side effect of making him treat people like napkins.)
- It helps to have no human connection in the upper echelon of management: makes it easier to do things in the interests of the organization or yourself

Practically all the company's
leaders were now in New York.. Over these men Rockefeller pre-
sided as absolute master. His preeminence was never questioned. In
spite of this, however, he made it a rule never to act without con-
sulting his colleagues and never to take an important step without
unanimous agreement of all the directors. There probably has
never been another such board of directors. They met daily. A ma-
jority could be assembled at a moment's notice for any important
action. They operated behind closed doors. They denied every-
thing and talked outside about nothing. As early as 1876 they
formed the habit of lunching together each day, at 140 Pearl
Street. William Rockefeller perhaps established and developed
the custom. Oddly enough, it was not John D. Rockefeller who
sat at the head of the long table, but Charles H . Pratt. On Pratt's
right sat Flagler, on his left Rogers.

Rockefeller expected these leaders to divest themselves of
details. Each plant, each corporation, was organized as a unit.
Its managers were given wide discretion and held accountable for
successful operation. These divisional chiefs were expected not to
trouble the minds of the leaders with small details. Rockefeller
set up a system of sifting committees, which were empowered to
handle all ordinary problems. Only the major question reached
the general staff. There was a committee on marketing, a crude
oil committee, a manufacturing committee, with departments deal-
ing with making refined products, developing new products. Com-
mittees covered all the functions of the vast business

Rockefeller's hatred of waste ran through the whole enterprise.
For the first time a business had been organized on the principle
of assembling the best brains in the industry and putting them to
work on all of its countless problems. The problem of waste was
one of these. Rockefeller saw that the waste of a few pounds which
would not be noted in a small business, when multiplied many
times in a huge concern, would amount to a large sum yearly

Could it collapse overnight? Almost certainly not: we've built it to contain any amount of damage, by organising it into around 300 limited companies. I think we've proved that a branded group of separate businesses, each with limited liability for its own financial affairs, makes sense.

Although the combined Virgin Group is the largest group of private companies in Europe, each individual company is generally relatively small in its sector. And so we have the advantage of being the nimble 'underdog' player in most markets.
