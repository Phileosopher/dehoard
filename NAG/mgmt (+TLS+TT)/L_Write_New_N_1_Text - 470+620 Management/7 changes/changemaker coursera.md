People need to understand WHY they're doing something uncomfortable and unpleasant

- This requires the changemaker to share that importance of the unrelated thing(s)

Principles of human-centered design solutions

1. stay focused - wicked challenges are nasty and easy to get distracted from
    - Have a narrow frame of reference
    - Dig deep, don't go broadly
2. encourage wild ideas - Any idea, no matter how silly or wild or impossible, could be the start of something big
3. have 1 conversation at a time - it creates focus on details
4. defer judgment - no idea is bad when brainstorming
5. be visual - use images to evoke feeling
    - People take on what they FEEL
        - Thus, adoption comes from feeling the benefit to doing that thing instead
        - It's pushing against habit, so it has to be a strong feeling to work

How to make a solution

A understand

- This requires empathy
- Analyzing systems
    - Who does what and how?
    - Who decides what?
    - Who gets what?
    - Who connects to whom?
    - Why are we doing what we're doing?

B observe

C create context

D create ideas

E prototype

- Must be 3 things:
    - economically doable
    - Technically doable
    - People want it
- Exists with several main variables
    - People - desires, reactions, etc
    - Process - methods and systems
    - Place - location, site, region, etc

F test

- This requires several things to succeed
    - Authenticity to own your mistakes
    - Have a code of ethics that you abide by
    - Clarify that it's ALL experimental (i.e., in constant beta)

LEADERSHIP POINT:
never do for others what they can do for themselves
this gives them power that you're stripping from them by otherwise
this is REALLY critical when the power dynamic is uneven (leadership, nursing homes, variable strengths, etc)
