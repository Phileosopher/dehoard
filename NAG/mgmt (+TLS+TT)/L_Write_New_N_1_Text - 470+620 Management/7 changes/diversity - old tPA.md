
An influential organization will cross cultural boundaries
- The rapid information society we live in ensures large organizations become well-known very quickly
- Form a vision with its global effect in mind
- Developed parts of the world often forget the myriad opportunities and risks from the developing world

### Many cultural risks will damage an organization on every level

Avoid favoritism towards family members
- Draft a family employee policy
- Define their roles and responsibilities very clearly
- Treat them like every other member of the team
- Don't hire your children right out of college
    - Let them work elsewhere in the world for a few years for them to gain much-needed experience

One of the most significant organizational risks is to connecting revenue to financial success
- Revenue doesn't consider profitability, inventory management, and cash flow
- Revenue also doesn't factor a product's marketability or the organization's debts

#### Bringing together multiple unrelated groups always has risks

Uncertainty will easily cripple morale and inspire fear, so boldly negotiate and discuss
- Don't pay too much additional for your hires (5% is fine, but 20-30% loses their value)

Avoid merging perceived equals
- A merger sounds fortunate but overlooks the two group cultures
- Look for irreconcilable differences in who has unspoken power in the groups

Make sure all the cultures complement each other
- Combining a group from related products, technologies or numbers leads to enormous conflicts

Acquisitions are unequal power dynamics and adapting is more challenging
- Don't let the concessions and clarifications from the acquired group give them all the power
- On the other hand, don't disrespect the acquisition's talents or work environment
