Hire a replacement with the right qualifications
- Have specific goals for your successor
- Don't make the decision alone
- Evaluate their personalities as thoroughly as you would with resumes
- The entire organization will be uneasy, so take time to adjust your protégé into the role
If you're selling or leaving the company, ease everyone's fears by taking everything slowly and transparently communicating everything

They listen to other people and have a team of great counsel for their decision-making
