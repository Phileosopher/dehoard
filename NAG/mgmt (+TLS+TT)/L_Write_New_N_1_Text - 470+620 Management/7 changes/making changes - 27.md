BEAT CHANGE TO THE PUNCH:
Carl Jung: "If there's a fear of falling, the only safety is deliberately jumping."
Scan trade publications and talk with peers to discover new technologies, business practices, or processes that might help you do your job better.

This is a book about the right question:
NOT : "How do we use the cool new tools to support our existing structure?",
but "How do we become an organization that thrives because of the new marketing?"
NOT : "How do we use this new marketing to maintain business as usual?",
but "How can our business itself be altered?"

Ask not what the new marketing can do for you.
Ask what you can do to thrive with the new marketing.

MEATBALL : a commodity, a branded item of little differentiation and decent quality.
You can't grow with meatballs because they're ubiquitious.
Stop making meatballs, and start making something that goes very well with hot fudge and marshmallow sauce.

Nimble, intelligent organizations that are poised and prepared, ready to be propelled by the fresh tactics of the new marketing.

Old toy fairs : the manufacturers would show the sellers the commercials 9 months in advance. The commercials that got the best reception led to toys getting made. The rest were cancelled.

We make what people buy. If it doesn't sell, it doesn't get made.

Business growth comes from satisfying the people who can best leverage your ideas.

New marketing doesn't demand better marketing. It demands better products, better services, and better organizations.

Marketing doesn't support the organization. The organization supports marketing.

Making noise is fun, but making noise is not where the highest returns lie.

Critical-Mass Checklist:
1. Do more users benefit the other users by bringing down prices or increasing the power of communication?
2. Are we falsely relying on the masses to solve problems that are obvious when we have small numbers of customers?
3. How can we lower the number of users we'll need before the benefits of critical mass kick in?
4. Does style matter? Are we betting people will become our customers because "everyone else is doing it"? If so, how do we realistically cross that chasm?

During times of change, the very last people you need on your team are well-paid bureaucrats, note takers, literalists.

The compliant masses don't help so much when you don't know what to do next.

What we must have are indispensable human beings. We need original thinkers, provocateurs, and people who care.

If you make your business possible to replicate, you're not going to be the one to replicate it. Others will. If you build a business filled with rules and procedures that are designed to allow you to hire cheap people, you will have to produce a product without humanity or personalization or connection. Which means that you'll have to lower your prices to compete. Which leads to a race to the bottom. Indispensable businesses race to the top instead.

Win by being more ordinary, more standard, and cheaper. Or win by being faster, more remarkable, and more human.

It's factory work because it's planned, controlled, and measured. It's factory work because you can optimize for productivity. These workers know what they're going to do all day-and it's still morning.

If we can put it in a manual, we can outsource it. If we can outsource it, we can get it cheaper.

The only way to get what you're worth is to stand out, to exert emotional labor, to be seen as indispensable, and to produce interactions that organizations and people care deeply about.

Paradigms are mental models that constrain our thinking and are often based on assumptions so strong we don't notice them. New paradigms cause disruption and uncertainty, even calamity, and are nearly always received with coolness, hostility, or worse. Vested interests fight against the change, and leaders of the old are often the last to embrace the new. Consequently, a paradigm shift typically causes a crisis of leadership.

Fine-tune your radar and move quickly to seize the opportunities for influence as a new business paradigm takes hold.

Profound changes favor the newcomer.

Throw away some of your detailed plans.

Leaders manage chaos the way a kindergarten teacher manages her students.

Planning must allow for a high degree of learning on your part. The great examples have adopted their strategies as they learned what worked and what did not work for the overall community.

- Abide by community norms
- Let the process evolve
- Hone your collaborative mind
