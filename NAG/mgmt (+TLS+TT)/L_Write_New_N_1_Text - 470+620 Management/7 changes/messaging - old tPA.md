
### Organizations only succeed with a well-communicated vision

The message must bring a passion for serving a higher purpose beyond self-interest
- Procedures and tasks change with culture and situation, but a vision won't move
- The purpose must form into something to specifically help someone
- The more straightforward and focused the message is, the farther and quicker it will travel
- The vision will carry itself far beyond the individual and into future generations when expressed correctly

Members of the organization should have more than enough training to succeed at working toward the vision
Everyone in the organization must be devoted wholly to the organization's vision
- The organization's principles should require members to adapt or leave
- Members must feel their input contributes to the collective vision

Ask all of the members what they think, not just the highest-ranking
Keep budget items for new communication channels
- Choose your communication channels carefully
- Use visuals to communicate more clearly
- Promote the organization more effectively with a young social media advisory board

Roll out products and services as an overall experience
- Advertise the ceremonious occasion with a fanfare
- Publicly put old and discontinued products to rest like a eulogy of a great idea that ran its course
- Invalidate and learn from dysfunctional products and services publicly to ensure the situation doesn't repeat itself
