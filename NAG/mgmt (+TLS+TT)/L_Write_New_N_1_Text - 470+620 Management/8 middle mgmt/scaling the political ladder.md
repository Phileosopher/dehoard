When a transportation officer admitted he did not know the whereabouts
of a customer's overdue shipment, Moyers snarled, "Well, you'd better
know tomorrow or you won't have a job."

Soon after arriving at Southern Pacific, Moyers called together 27 vice
presidents and told them that within two months many of them would be
gone. The meeting was over.

The transaction created the nation's largest railroad and left Phil
Anschutz as its largest shareholder. Now it was time for him to go into
high gear by applying the billionaires' principle "Keep on Growing."

An ordinary entrepreneur might have simply declared victory after
parlaying $90 million into $1.4 billion, but not Anschutz. While cashing
in his railroad investment, he held on to a fiber-optics operation he
had constructed along the Southern Pacific's rights-of-way. The company,
Qwest Communications International, went public less than a year after
the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger cleared its last regulatory
hurdle. Within six months, the stock had risen by about 175 percent. The
85 percent stake that Anschutz retained was valued at $3.5 billion; his
initial investment in the venture amounted to only $55 million.

An analysis of the great fortunes founded since the nineteenth century
showed you that they greatly improved their chances by focusing their
energies in high-growth industries. You then studied the nine
fundamental strategies that the self-made billionaires pursued:
- Take Extraordinary Risks
- Do Business in a New Way
- Dominate Your Market
- Consolidate an Industry
- Buy Low
- Thrive on Deals
- Outmanage the Competition
- Invest in Political Influence
- Resist the Unions

The billionaires' stories showed you the extraordinary power of the
following key principles:
- Pursue the Money in Ideas
- Rules Are Breakable
- Copying Pays Better Than Innovating
- Keep on Growing
- Hold on to Your Equity
- Hard Work Is Essential
- Use Financial Leverage
- Keep the Back Door Open
- Make Mistakes, Then Learn from Them
- Frugality Pays
- Enjoy the Pursuit
- Develop a Thick Skin

Overcome the leveling effects of competition by applying superior
management skills or investing in political influence.

Genuinely resolving to become a billionaire means committing yourself
wholeheartedly to the goal. It requires a dedication no less intense
than training to swim the English Channel. Making up your mind to be
superrich means subordinating other goals to an all-consuming quest for
wealth.

You will not prosper by performing any activity in a perfunctory way,
regardless of whether it has to do with making money. Far from
distracting you from the goal of becoming superrich, intensely applying
yourself to other aspects of your life will cultivate the habit of
excelling.

Bill Gates's intensity extends beyond the workplace. When he was dating
Ann Winblad, another pioneer in the computer software industry, the
couple chose motifs for the brief vacations they could spare the time to
take. On a physics-themed vacation, for example, they read as many books
on the subject as they could pack and listened to recordings of a
lecture series by Richard Feynman.
