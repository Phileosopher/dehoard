It would be inaccurate to characterize the subjects of How to Be a
Billionaire as hands-on managers. Getting bogged down in operational
details would have diverted their attention from the more essential task
of amassing personal wealth. Instead, they have focused on three
essential aspects of management: organization, recruitment, and motivation.

• Attract managers with enough self-confidence to challenge your own
judgment on matters.
• Delegate authority to detail-oriented executives who can free you to
concentrate on billion-dollar ideas.
• Stay close enough to operations to be aware of problems and
opportunities, making sure that your lieutenants follow up on
suggestions for improvement.
• Constantly reinforce a focus on controlling costs.
• Use equity incentives to provide your managers and other key employees
a realistic chance to become millionaires.
• Show genuine, personal concern for people within your organization.
• Promote morale by maintaining a sense of fun along with seriousness of
purpose.

Branson motivates employees to excel by putting them into slightly
higher positions than they expect. Like Kirk Kerkorian, Branson has no
difficulty delegating day-to-day operations, much preferring to spend
his time on new ventures. As long as a business is doing well, he does
not bother to meet with management, while making himself available for
crises.
