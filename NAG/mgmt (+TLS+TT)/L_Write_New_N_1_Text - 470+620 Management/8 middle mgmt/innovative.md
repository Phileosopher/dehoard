Group-thinkers have not cracked the Forbes 400 in significant numbers
for one simple reason: Doing the same thing in the same way as everyone
else is decidedly not the way to overcome the leveling effects of
competition.

Outorganizing the competition, in contrast, is one proven method of
breaking away from the pack. The opportunity arises precisely because of
certain maladies that give the word "organization" a negative
connotation. Companies that exhibit the following sorts of behavior
become sitting ducks for rivals that can respond quickly and effectively
to an evolving competitive environment:
• Long lines of communication keep senior management unaware of changes
in the marketplace.
• Fear of rocking the boat discourages employees from coming forward
with worthwhile ideas.
• Primary focus on avoiding mistakes deters managers from taking risks.
• Obsession with defending turf diverts managers from capitalizing on
business opportunities.
