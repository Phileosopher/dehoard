
If you watch kids learning dyno (rock climbing) you'll see that the secret to developing the skill isn't about building their muscles or learning some exotic technique. It's merely about developing the faith that it'll work. Without faith, the leap never works.

There are countless religions in our lives.
The religion of Broadway determines what a musical is supposed to look and feel like.
The religion of the MBA standard curriculum and perceptions of what is successful.

Religion gives our faith a little support when it needs it.

Religion at its best is a sort of mantra, a subtle but consistent reminder that belief is OK, and that faith is the way to get where you're going.

Religion at its worst reinforces the status quo, often at the expense of our faith.

Sticking, without variation, to principles prevented them from turning it into a new better kind of experience.

Heretics challenge a given religion, but do it from a very strong foundation of faith. In order to lead, you must challenge the status quo of the religion you're living under.

Successful heretics create their own religion. New group of friends, new supporters, new rituals.

Recognize the need for faith in your idea. Find the tribe you need to support you and create a new religion around your faith.

When you fall in love with a system, you lose the ability to grow.
