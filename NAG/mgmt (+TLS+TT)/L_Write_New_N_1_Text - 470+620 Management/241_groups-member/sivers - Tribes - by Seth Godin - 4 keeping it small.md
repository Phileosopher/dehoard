
Imagine two classrooms with similar teachers. One has 15 students, the other, 32. Which group gets a better education? The smaller class - because the teacher has more time to spend customizing the lesson to each student. She has fewer students, hence fewer disruptions as well.

Great leaders don't try to please everyone.
Great leaders don't water down their message in order to make the tribe a bit bigger.

Some tribes do better when they're smaller. More exclusive. Harder to get into. Some tribes thrive precisely because they're small. Push to make one of these tribes bigger and you might just ruin the entire thing. "No one goes there anymore - it's too popular."

Leaders who set out to give are more productive than leaders who set out to get.

The tribes can sniff out why someone is asking for their attention.
