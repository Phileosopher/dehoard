
Blind sheep do nothing but mindlessly follow instructions.
They don't do the local leadership required when tribe members interact.
They're not going to do a very good job of recruiting new members. Evangelism requires leadership.

People eagerly engage when they want something to improve. This microleadership is essential.
It's the microleaders in the trenches and their enthusiastic followers who make the difference, not the honcho who is ostensibly running the group.

Leaders work hard to generate movement that can transform a group into a tribe.

The posture of leaning in is rare and valuable.

When looking to hire - I set up a private Facebook group for the applicants and invited each one to participate. 60 of them joined immediately. No tribe existed yet - just 60 strangers. Within hours, a few had taken the lead, posting topics, starting discussions, leaning in and leading. They called on their peers to contribute and participate. And the rest? They lurked.

Whom would you hire?

Not all leadership involves getting in the face of the tribe. It takes just as much effort to successfully get out of the way. Jimmy Wales leads Wikipedia not by inciting, but by enabling others to fill the vacuum.

The one path that never works is the most common one : doing nothing at all.

The difference between backing off and doing nothing may appear subtle, but it's not. A leader who backs off is making a commitment to the power of the tribe, and is alert to the right moment to step back in. Someone who is doing nothing is merely hiding.

Leadership is a choice. It's the choice to not do nothing. Lean in, back off, but don't do nothing.

Others will scoff and move on, wondering what the obsession is all about. That's what makes a tribe, of course. There are insiders and outsiders.

Curious is the key word. It has to do with a desire to understand, a desire to try, a desire to push whatever envelope is interesting. Leaders are curious because they can't wait to find out what the group is going to do next. The changes in the tribe are what are interesting, and curiosity drives them.

In order to lead a tribe, all you need to do is motivate people who choose to follow you.
