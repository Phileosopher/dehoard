
The customer service staff shows up and follows the handbook and treats every customer the same, then can't figure out why they're being disrespected in return.

Be willing to be wrong.
Realize that wrong isn't fatal.

The secret of leadership : paint a picture of the future. Go there.

It's OK to abandon the big, established, stuck tribe. It's OK to say, "You're not going where I need to go, and there's no way I'm going to persuade all of you to follow me. So rather than standing here watching the opportunities fade away, I'm heading off. I'm betting some of you, the best of you, will follow me."

You can build a bigger, faster, cheaper tribe than you used to be able to. Transaction costs are falling while the costs of formal organizations (offices, benefits, management) keep increasing.

Many big organizations are getting bigger as a way of fighting off the power of the tribes. Hoping that formal nature of their bigness will somehow successfully fight off flexible, fast, and sometimes free power of the tribe. (Very unlikely.)

If you hear my idea but don't believe it, that's not your fault - it's mine.
If you are a student in my class and you don't learn what I'm teaching, I've let you down.

It's really easy to insist that people read the manual.
It's really easy to blame the user/student/customer for not trying hard, for being too stupid to get it, for not caring enough to pay attention.
It's tempting to blame those in your tribe who aren't working as hard at following as you are at leading.
But none of this is helpful.

If no one cares, then you have no tribe. If you don't care - really and deeply care - then you can't possibly lead.

Leaders create a culture around their goal and involve others in that culture.

People want to be sure you heard what they said. They're less focused on whether or not you do what they said.
Listen. Really listen. Then decide and move on.


Find one person who trusts you and sell him a copy. Does he love it? Is he excited about it? Excited enough to tell 10 friends because it helps them, not because it helps you?

Tribes grow when people recruit other people. That's how ideas spread as well. The tribe doesn't do it for you, of course. They do it for each other.

A big part of leadership is the ability to stick with the dream for a long time. Long enough that the critics realize that you're going to get there one way or another - so they follow.

People don't believe what you tell them.
They rarely believe what you show them.
Then often believe what their friends tell them.
They always believe what they tell themselves.
What leaders do : give people stories they can tell themselves. Stories about the future and about change.
