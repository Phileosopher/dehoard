Most of the barriers to group action have collapsed, and without those barriers, we are free to explore new ways of gathering together and getting things done.

The costs incurred by creating a new group or joining an existing one have collapsed, not just in money but in time, effort and attention.
- THE BARRIER TO GROUP FORMATION IS SHARED INFORMATION, MEANING IT GROWS AND DIES AT THE SPEED OF INFORMATION [TECHNOLOGY]

Individuals in group settings exhibit behaviors that no one could predict by studying single minds. No one has ever been bashful or extroverted while sitting alone in their room, no one can be a social climber or a man of the people without reference to society, and these characteristics exist because groups are not just simple aggregations of individuals.

Typical organization is hierarchical, which vastly simplifies communication among employees. New employees only need one connection, to their boss, to get started. That's much simpler than trying to have everyone talk to everyone.

With low-enough barriers to participate, people are not just willing but eager to join together to try things, even if most of those things end up not working.

Linux got to be world-changingly good, not by promising to be great or by bringing paid developers together under the direction of some master plan, but by getting incrementally better, through voluntary contributions, one version at a time.

Linus said, "I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them." This kind of openness is thekey to any project relying on peer production.

The number of people who are willing to start something is MUCH smaller than the number of people willing to contribute once someone else starts something.

Open systems lower the cost of failure. They do not create biases in favor of predictable but substandard outcomes, and they make it simpler to integrate the contributions of people who contribute only a single idea.

The overall effect of failure is its likelihood times its cost. Most organizations attempt to reduce the effect of failure by reducing its likelihood. Open source doesn't reduce the likelihood of failure, but it does reduce its cost.

Cheap failure, valueable as it is on its own, is also a key part of a more complex advantage : the exploration of multiple possibilities.

The resources invested in trying these actions will often cost more than the outcome. This in turn means there are many actions that might pay off but won't be tried, even for innovative firms, because their eventual success is not predictable enough.

It is this gap that distribution exploration takes advantage of : in a world where anyone can try anything, even the risky stuff can be tried eventually. If enough people are trying things, the happy accidents have a much higher chance of being discovered.
- THIS ENTIRE REASONING IS WHY, AS [SPECIALIZATION] SCALES, THE [TECHNICAL IDIOT] IS BORN

There is something offensive in having a nationality without skin in the game, just to travel and pass borders, without the downside that comes with the passport.
Unless I developed an emotional attachment to France via skin in the game, I couldn't take French citizenship.
But I came to the U.S., embraced the place, and took the passport as commitment: it became my identity, good or bad, tax or no tax.
- it's a matter of [identity]

If wanted to lower taxes for myself, and I do, I am obligated to fight for it, for both myself and the collective, other taxpayers, and to not run away.
- the decision to sacrifice for self-interest within the group defines part of our [identity] with that group

Leadership: Better to have an army of sheep led by a lion than an army of lions led by a sheep.

There's a large payoff from stubborn courage.

A small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.
- TECHNICALLY, THEY'RE ALWAYS SMALL GROUPS THAT RUN BIG GROUPS

A group transitions itself through [values] shared by that group, but it shifts through stages:
1. the group starts small, with everyone essentially sharing in 1 singular value
2. eventually, someone is included in the group who is NOT affiliated with that value directly, but is still accepted for some other [reason](purpose)
3. more of the "non-value-honoring" people join, up until they represent at least a significant minority of the entire group
4. the group informally divides itself into an upper echelon of purists (who are essentially the "leadership") and the lower echelon of attenders/members
5. the group's core values maintain themselves with the [influence] of that group, subtracted by the non-committal nature of the non-value-honoring people, multiplied by the leadership's central messaging
6. eventually, the [power dynamics] of the group's leadership devolve into a tribal dispute over something NOT related to that group's value
7. there is either a schism or dissolution of that group, with the purists branching off to form another group and repeat the process
