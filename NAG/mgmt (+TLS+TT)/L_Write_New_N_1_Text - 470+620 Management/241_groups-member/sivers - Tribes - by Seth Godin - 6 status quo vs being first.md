
Leadership almost always involves thinking and acting like the underdog. That's because leaders work to change things, and the people who are winning rarely do.

Leaders go first.
Initiating : see something others are ignoring and jump on it.
Cause the events that others have to react to.
Make change.

Everyone believes that what they've got is probably better than the risk and fear that come with change.

At first, the new thing is rarely as good as the old thing was.
If you need the alternative to be better than the status quo from the very start, you'll never begin.
Soon enough, the new thing will be better than the old thing. But if you wait until then, it's going to be too late.

This isn't about having a great idea. The great ideas are out there, for free, on your neighborhood blog. This is about taking initiative and making things happen.

Getting out first and staking out the new territory almost always pays off.

When you hire amazing people and give them freedom, they do amazing stuff.

The biggest step comes from anyone who teachers or hires. Embrace non-sheep behavior. Reward and cherish it.
