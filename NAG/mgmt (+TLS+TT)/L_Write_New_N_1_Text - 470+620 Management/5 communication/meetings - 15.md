Meetings : Verbatim minutes are taken. I read all of the minutes of these meetings very carefully and I can get a mite cross if they are not produced promptly and accurately. For me they are not a memorandum of past events. They are a tool to understanding current positions. I also have my personal financial manager as well as my group CFO placed on all these boards. If I'm not present you can be sure he is.

NOTE: INDICATE ROBERT'S RULES

Don't schedule important meetings at 3 p.m. It just doesn't make sense because you need naps!

Try to avoid all unnecessary meetings

Most meetings can be summarized by an email

- Be clear about the specified end time, which should never be more than 30 minutes unless it's critical

The human brain evolved under conditions of almost constant motion. From
this, one might predict that the optimal environment for processing
information would include motion. That is exactly what one finds.
Indeed, the best business meeting would have everyone walking at about
1.8 miles per hour.

Managers as input/output machines
When I first started working with my PhD advisor, I thought our weekly meeting was for me to prove to him that I had been productive.
That is false.
Now that I have grad students, I see this same behavior. But it isn't a good use of anyone's time.
These meetings are for getting feedback.
In the words of my PhD advisor: "advisors are input/output machines". You put into it your update and you get back feedback. The meeting is for your benefit.
However, you have to show up with something in order to get feedback. If all you say is "I'm still looking into that one thing" or "I'm stuck", then there is little to go off of. Sometimes that happens though. But if you want help from your advisor/manager, you have to show up with something. This is virtually always possible to do, even if you think you didn't make progress, though it does take a bit effort to get organized.

A few suggestions for running update meetings with your advisor/manager:
Assume they forgot everything that was said last meeting.
Show up with things to talk about and a goal.
In 3-4 sentences, refresh everyone's memory about the last meeting and what you were supposed to accomplish since then.
In 4-6 sentences, summarize what you did, what worked, what didn't work, and what you think you should do next. Think of this as bullet points.
Avoid diving into details until you know everyone is on the same page and caught up.
If possible, show up with something tangible, like a visual aid, a demo, a draft, or at least some notes.

My advice, based on thousands of such meetings over the years, is to keep them short. Unless your gut tells you you've stumbled across a winner, set the meeting at 20 minutes. Have someone interrupt you after 25 minutes and have the caller ushered swiftly from your room.

MEETINGS : Indians meet not so much to discuss and deliberate, but to
present the results of their discussions and deliberations.

On Meetings:
- Meetings start off innocuously, with a few people, maybe once a month
- Then it gets larger, and the meetings get more frequent
- Then it gets longer, to keep everyone updated
- eventually, it's every 2-3 workdays, 90 minutes each, making the effective workweek 37 hours without overtime
- the manager must be mindful of when people:
    - start getting bored, since the [speaker] isn't making it interesting, and the workday will suffer from their unhappiness
    - don't need to be there because it's irrelevant to them (for pending decisions), and can be put in an email for them to skim if they need
- further, the topics that DO need addressing need to be chopped up:
    - 1 topic per decision-making meeting
    - meet as-needed, and expect it to take 3-4 times longer than you'd think (either from limited [understanding], unforeseen [conflicts], or [as-of-yet unknown] information)

Gates estimates that he devotes 70 percent of his time to review
meetings with small product development teams.

Get as many people as possible into one room. And then go somewhere else.
