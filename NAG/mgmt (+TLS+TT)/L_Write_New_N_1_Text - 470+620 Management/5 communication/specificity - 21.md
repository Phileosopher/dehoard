RESTAURANT: A checklist for every customer. When an order was placed up
front, it was printed out on a slip back in the kitchen. The ticket
specified the dishes ordered, the table number, the seat number, any
preferences required by the customer or noted in a database from
previous visits - food allergies, for instance, or how the steak should
be cooked, or whether this was a special occasion like a birthday or a
visit from a VIP.

You must define a clear pause point at which the checklist is supposed
to be used

You must decide whether you want a DO-CONFIRM checklist or a READ-DO
checklist.

DO-CONFIRM checklist:
â€¦ team members perform their jobs from memory and experience, often
separately. But then they stop.
They pause to run the checklist and confirm that everything that was
supposed to be done was done.

READ-DO checklist:
people carry out the tasks as they check them off - it's more like a recipe.

We adopted mainly a DO-CONFIRM rather than a READ-DO format, to give
people greater flexibility in performing their tasks while nonetheless
having them stop at key points to confirm that critical steps have not
been overlooked.

Must nurses make written check marks? No, we decided, they didn't have
to. This wasn't a record-keeping procedure. We were aiming for a team
conversation to ensure that everyone had reviewed what was needed

We had a team in London try the draft checklist and give us suggestions,
then a team in Hong Kong. With each successive round, the checklist got
better.

Even the most expert among us can gain from searching out the patterns
of mistakes and failures and putting a few checks in place.

The handbook was comprised not of one checklist but of scores of them.
Each one was remarkably brief, usually just a few lines on a page in
big, easy-to-read type. And each applied to a different situation. Taken
together, they covered a vast range of flight scenarios. First came what
pilots call their "normal" checklists - the routine lists they use for
everyday aircraft operations. There were the checks they do before
starting the engines, before pulling away from the gate, before taxiing
to the runway, and so on. In all, these took up just three pages. The
rest of the handbook consisted of the "non-normal" checklists covering
every conceivable emergency situation a pilot might run into: smoke in
the cockpit, different warning lights turning on, a dead radio, a
copilot becoming disabled, and engine failure, to name just a few. They
addressed situations most pilots never encounter in their entire
careers. But the checklists were there should they need them.

These things mean NO to a high-context person:
- responding with a question
- won't answer your question
- hesitate
- qualified yes ("maybe" or "should be possible")
- postponing ("let me ask my team")
- saying how busy they are
- agreeing at first, but then asking about it again later

These are ASKING FOR HELP to a high-context person:
- saying how busy they are
- saying something is taking longer than expected
- implying a deadline might be missed (you are supposed to ask why)
- something is more complicated than they thought
- talking about another team that recently needed and received help
- talking about a time when they received help in the past

These are NEGATIVE CRITICISM ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL to a high-context person:
- avoiding any response
- repeating your suggestion
- a loud silence
- suggesting an alternative
- asking your opinion of your own idea
- only praising part of it

If you want Indians to be more direct, you have to tell them several
times, and give them time to get used to being what they regard as
impolite. Give strong feedback as soon as you see the least sign of
Indians doing what you've asked.

Don't telegraph the answer you want. They will say what they think you
want to hear. Don't say, "That won't take long, will it?" or "Can you
get it done by Friday?"

If you really want to know what they think, don't begin by telling them
what you think.

In India, bosses do not empower subbordinates. They are expected to check-in
constantly to get the boss's OK. Subbordinates should never act empowered.
When talking to a team, you must talk to the boss, not the subbordinates.

The more guidance, the better. Explicit, detailed, specific instructions.

Have formal written business processes for every signifiant job function. Outsource it to a consultant who specializes in creating and maintaining written business processes.

If you are trying to persuade someone to join you, invest with you, or make some changes, then it's important to speak to them directly and take the time so that they know what they must do.

Remember to communicate, and pay attention to detail. You wouldn't believe how far you can get, just by remembering and practising those two rules.
