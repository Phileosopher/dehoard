
## WHAT TO DO : REQUIREMENTS, STATEMENTS

The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding what to build.

A requirement is a carefully written description of a criterion that the work is expected to satisfy.
Good requirements are easy to understand and hard to misinterpret.

Vision documents directly define the "what" of a project.
Specs define the "how" of a project.
Work breakdowns define the "how" of a project, from a team perspective.

Specs are complete when they provide a workable plan that engineering can use to fulfill requirements.

A vision document is where all of the perspectives, research, and strategy are synthesized together.
The simplest tool is the use of requirements.

A requirement is anything the team (and client) agrees will be satisfied when the project is completed.

Problem statements are 1-2 sentence descriptions of specific end-user issues, written in a format that identifies a problem or need from the customer perspective.
Problem statements are broader than bugs, because their goal is to capture what's missing from the customer perspective, instead of only what's broken from the technical perspective.
Problem statements should remain purely about customers and their needs.
Problem statements need to be converted into feature statements / scenarios.
Feature statement is a short description of something a customer will be able to do as a result of the project or tasks they will no longer have to do because the project automates those tasks for them.
Avoid any description of how these benefits will be achieved.
Feature statements should never describe a specific solution or design, but should instead explain the solution's impact on the customer.
Require a temporary ban on solution proposals during discussions of problem lists and scenarios.
Postpone discussion about design alternatives. Focus on clarifying the real goals of the project, ordered by importance.

Problem statements and scenarios are a simple way to define and communicate requirements. They are easily converted into design ideas without losing clarity about what's important and what isn't.
