The checklist cannot be lengthy.
A rule of thumb some use is to keep it to between five and nine items,

After about sixty to ninety seconds at a given pause point, the
checklist often becomes a distraction from other things. People start
"shortcutting." Steps get missed.
So you want to keep the list short by focusing on what he called "the
killer items" - the steps that are most dangerous to skip and sometimes
overlooked nonetheless.

Ideally, it should fit on one page.

It is common to misconceive how checklists function in complex lines of
work. They are not comprehensive how-to guides.
They are quick and simple tools aimed to buttress the skills of expert
professionals.

NOTE: MAKE COMMENTS RE: SAFETY TEAMS AND ENDLESS SAFETY STANDARDS THAT NOBODY COMPLIES WITH
- It's better to have 15 rules that everyone follows than 500 that nobody does, and additional rules don't help
- if the work is VERY intricate, it's wiser to focus on emphasizing the importance of safety over speed or efficiency

Balance between brevity and effectiveness. Cut too much and you won't
have enough checks to improve care. Leave too much in and the list
becomes too long to use. Furthermore, an item critical to one expert
might not be critical to another.

BAD CHECKLISTS
… are vague and imprecise.
They are too long; they are hard to use; they are impractical.
They are made by desk jockeys with no awareness of the situations in
which they are to be deployed.
They treat the people using the tools as dumb and try to spell out every
single step.
They turn people's brains off rather than turn them on.

GOOD CHECKLISTS
… are precise.
They are efficient, to the point, and easy to use even in the most
difficult situations.
They do not try to spell out everything - a checklist cannot fly a plane.
They provide reminders of only the most critical and important steps -
the ones that even the highly skilled professionals using them could miss.
Good checklists are, above all, practical.

The power of checklists is limited.
They can help experts remember how to manage a complex process or
configure a complex machine.
They can make priorities clearer and prompt people to function better as
a team.
By themselves, however, checklists cannot make anyone follow them.

Strive for good design; it really works better.

MANAGEMENT IS SIMPLICITY
- Give people WHAT to do, then expand MORE information as they request or is needed
- Don't overload them with arbitrary info, people get overwhelmed or start managing themselves instead of trusting your guidance!

Don't waste your precious time. Phone calls and emails can eat your day. Don't let them. No one will think less of you for getting to the point. Because there are so many calls to make every day, I generally keep them very brief. And a short note to somebody is often quicker than a phone call. As the business has got bigger and spread across the globe, a lot is dealt with by short notes.
