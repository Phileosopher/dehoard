Distinguish between someone truly wanting and needing help, and someone
who is merely exploiting a willing helper.

All you have to do isâ€¦ nothing. When someone offers a
less-than-brilliant idea in a meeting, don't criticize it. Say nothing.
When someone challenges one of your decisions, don't argue with them or
make excuses. Quietly consider it and say nothing. When someone makes a
helpful suggestion, don't remind them that you already knew that. Thank
them and say nothing. This is not a semantic game. The beauty of knowing
what to stop - of achieving this state of inspired neutrality - is that
it is so easy to do.

Hone a quick wit. Look for connections or analogies between unrelated
things.
- [creative] thinking can take you VERY far

If you want a team to NOT consult you for everything:
1. tell them you want them to take responsibility and not check with you
2. explain why : that you find it inefficient and a poor use of your time
3. reassure them that even though what you're asking would feel
    uncomfortable in their culture, it's OK in yours
4. repeat the advice a number of times
5. give them time to practice
6. immediate positive feedback

To get beyond the "doing only what's told":
1. encourage them to apply the instructions to an entire category of
    things, not only what's said
2. encourage them to be more direct in questioning innaccurate or wrong
    instructions
3. encourage them to be more direct in suggesting a better way of doing
    something

Addressing questions or remarks directly to subordinates is likely to be
seen by Indians as an attempt to circumvent the chain of command.
Everything must go through the manager/supervisor.

Praise the team, not the individual. They regard themselves as family,
collaborating, not competing. Praising one subordinate in front of the
others is an insult to the rest of the group, and an embarrassment for
the person singled out.

Planes are safer when the least experienced pilot is flying, because it
means the second pilot isn't going to be afraid to speak up. Combating
mitigation.
- rigidly enforced egalitarianism is the ONLY way to combat this

I don't think there has ever been a letter from my office which criticises the staff or an individual. Now and again I've disagreed with something and suggested changes in behaviour. But the Virgin Group has always tried to look for the best in people. That way, you get the best back.

You'd be amazed how quickly people change for the better, given the right circumstances, and how willing they are to learn from costly mistakes when offered a second chance. If you've over-promoted someone and it hasn't worked out, then offer them their old job back rather than firing them. It's your fault for over-promoting them. Not theirs.

Decent leadership is about explaining clearly and unemotionally why a decision has been taken.

The Dalai Lama said, "If you wish to experience peace - provide peace for another. If you wish to know that you are safe, cause others to know that they are safe. If you wish to understand seemingly incomprehensible things, help another better understand."

The most skilled and experienced members of the community provide leadership and help integrate contributions from the community.

Peering helps assign the right person to the right task more effectively than traditional firms. The reason is self-selection: when people voluntarily self-select for creative, knowledge-intensive tasks, they are more likely than managers to choose tasks for which they are uniquely qualified.

As long as communities have mechanisms for weeding out weak contributions, then large self-selecting communities of people in constant communication have a higher probability of matching the best people to the right tasks.

Collaborative outsourcing works best in areas that are not core to your product or central to your business model. Weaknesses. Areas where your market efforts have floundered.

men vs women in workplace
- men crave autonomy, and a healthy work environment involves many autonomous individuals who delegate responsibility by their volitional choice from finding meaning in sharing the work
- women generally want more affection, validation, and feedback, meaning there's plenty more dialogue
- this is not a hard-and-fast rule, but conventional [gender] roles are guaranteed to play out among larger groups
