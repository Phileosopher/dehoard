To ask a CEO to spend four hours thinking deeply about a single problem
is a waste of what makes him or her valuable. It's better to hire three
smart subordinates to think deeply about the problem and then bring
their solutions to the executive for a final decision. This specificity
is important because it tells us that if you're a high-level executive
at a major company, you probably don't need the advice in the pages that
follow. On the other hand, it also tells us that you cannot extrapolate
the approach of these executives to other jobs.

Before you ask anyone else to be involved, ask, "Do I really need this
person's time? Can I do it on my own?"
If you need the other person, define specifically what you need. Explain
why their involvement is important.
Give them everything they need to get up to speed. People don't mind
giving their time if they feel it's valued and helpful.
It's your reponsibility to have thought that through before you approach
them.

When you're confronted with complex, nonroutine problems, push the power
of decision making out to the periphery and away from the center. Give
people the room to adapt, based on their experience and expertise. All
you ask is that they talk to one another and take responsibility.

They had made the reliable management of complexity a routine. That
routine requires balancing a number of virtues: freedom and discipline,
craft and protocol, specialized ability and group collaboration. And for
checklists to help achieve that balance, they have to take two almost
opposing forms. They supply a set of checks to ensure the stupid but
critical stuff is not overlooked, and they supply another set of checks
to ensure people talk and coordinate and accept responsibility while
nonetheless being left the power to manage the nuances

IF YOU WANT SOMETHING, ASK FOR IT
Don't beat around the bush. Don't assume people will know what you need. Don't make them guess.
The more specific you are about what you need, the faster you'll get it.
If asking an employee or peer, clearly frame your request and set a deadline.

Routine work can be outsourced or automated; artistic, empathic, nonroutine work generally cannot.

Someone outside your organization knows how to answer your specific question, solve your specific problem, or take advantage of your current opportunity better than you do. You need to find them, and find a way to work collaboratively and productively with them.

Whatever you are doing in your business right now, your goal really is to find a way to quit it. You need to stop doing almost everything you do at the office. Be a quitter.

Organize the talented. Connect the disconnected.
