there was once controversy about using emails to setup a lunch date with a colleague (like using Facebook on company time now)
- social media will be used no matter what, and that's tied directly to the [personality] of the hires
- if you have a problem with it, focus on results and leave them the hell alone

Trust in the power of communication. Don't believe in the wisdom of the
single individual, of even an expert. Believe in the wisdom of the
group, the wisdom of making sure that multiple pairs of eyes were on a
problem and then letting the watchers decide what to do.

TELL THEM WHAT'S ON THE TEST
Tell people how they will be measured, so they can focus on the most important things.
To reinforce performance, link a portion of the compensation to their performance in those areas.

We should all pledge to do nothing that we'd regret reading about in the press.

The mass market is dead, replaced by the mass of niches.

We have shifted from an economy based on scarcity to one based on abundance. The control of products or distribution will no longer guarantee a premium and a profit.

Enabling customers to collaborate with you - in creating, distributing, marketing, and supporting products - is what creates a premium in today's market.

The most successful enterprises today are networks - which extract as little value as possible so they can grow as big as possible - and the platforms on which those networks are built.

Owning pipelines, people, products, or even intellectual property is no longer the key to success. Openness is.

Yahoo and AOL are already has-beens. They operate under the old rules. They control content and distribution and think they can own customers, relationships, and attention. They create destinations and have the hubris to think customers should come to them. They spend a huge portion of their revenue on marketing to get those people there and work hard to keep them there.

Give the people control, and we will use it. Don't, and you will lose us. That is the essential rule.

As a business owner, respond to people. Don't rely on an intern or PR company to make the search and contact. Do it yourself. Be yourself. Find someone who has a problem. Find out more about the problem by engaging in conversation. Solve it. Learn from it. Then tell people what you learned. You might have had such exchanges over the years via letters, phone calls, and underlings. But now the conversation will occur in public, as will your education.

As with free speech itself, what we say isn't as important as the system that enables us to say it. That system requires that everything about you, your product, your business, and your message, has a place online with a permanent address so people can search and find you, then point to you, respond to you, and even distribute what you have to say.

Firms that cultivate nimble trust-based relationships with external collaborators are positioned to form vibrant business ecosystems that create value more effectively than hierarchially organized business.

This threatens entrenched barriers to entry, including the high costs of obtaining the financial, physical, and human capital necessary to compete.

Firms can no longer depend only on internal capabilities or a handful of business partners to meet external needs.

Companies that make their boundaries porous to external ideas and human capital outperform companies that rely solely on their internal resources.

When companies are open, customers respond by giving their trust.

A firm will expand until the costs of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on the open market. As long as it is cheaper to perform a transaction inside your firm, keep it there. But if it is cheaper to go to the marketplace, do not try to do it internally.

Or, backwards : firms should shrink until the cost of performing a transaction internally no longer exceeds the cost of performing it externally.

The main reason for taking Perot Systems public in 1999, he says, was to
motivate employees. "I want them to know what their work has produced in
the way of value. Nothing motivates a team like having them have stock."

You will have to supplement your native talent with acquired skills.
To become an outstanding builder of organizations, Wayne Huizenga had to
correct an early tendency to be curt toward people who did not grasp
points he considered self-evident. Intimidated by this reaction,
employees would sometimes fail to pass along important information.
Ross Perot and Sam Walton had to revise their original inclination to
reward only senior managers generously, which caused lower-level
employees to feel like second-class citizens.
This sort of adaptability is one of the most important traits that you
should strive to stamp on your organization.

Create an "aura of authenticity," which is the elixir that attracts smart people and inspires them.

Monitor search queries. If users are asking questions, write articles with those answers. Keeping an eye on search terms is a preemptive reader survey.

Publicness is a key attribute of successful business. We now live and do business is glass houses (and offices).

Take actions in public so people can see what you do and react to it, make suggestions, and tell their friends.

Customer service is the new marketing.
