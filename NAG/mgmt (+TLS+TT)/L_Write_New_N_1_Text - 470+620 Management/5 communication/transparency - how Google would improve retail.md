
Imagine a restaurant run on openness and data. The menu shows exactly how many people had ordered each dish. Survey diners at the end of the meal.

The more layers of data you have, the more you learn, the more useful your advice can be. You could show what dishes are popular with runners!

Open-source the restaurant. Put recipes online, and invite the public to make suggestions.
