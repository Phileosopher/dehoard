## DIRECT the Rider

FOLLOW THE BRIGHT SPOTS.
Investigate what's working and clone it.
[Jerry Sternin in Vietnam, solutions-focused therapy]

SCRIPT THE CRITICAL MOVES.
Don't think big picture, think in terms of specific behaviors.
[1% milk, four rules at the Brazilian railroad]

POINT TO THE DESTINATION.
Change is easier when you know where you're going and why it's worth it.
["You'll be third graders soon," "No dry holes" at BP]

## MOTIVATE the Elephant

FIND THE FEELING.
Knowing something isn't enough to cause change. Make people feel something.
[Piling gloves on the table, the chemotherapy video game, Robyn Waters's
demos at Target]

SHRINK THE CHANGE.
Break down the change until it no longer spooks the Elephant.
[The 5-Minute Room Rescue, procurement reform]

GROW YOUR PEOPLE.
Cultivate a sense of identity and instill the growth mindset.
[Brasilata's "inventors," junior-high math kids' turnaround]

## SHAPE the Path

TWEAK THE ENVIRONMENT.
When the situation changes, the behavior changes. So change the situation.
[Throwing out the phone system at Rackspace, 1-Click ordering,
simplifying the online time sheet]

BUILD HABITS.
When behavior is habitual, it's "free" - it doesn't tax the Rider.
Look for ways to encourage habits.
[Setting "action triggers," eating two bowls of soup while dieting,
using checklists]

RALLY THE HERD.
Behavior is contagious. Help it spread.
["Fataki" in Tanzania, "free spaces" in hospitals, seeding the tip jar]
