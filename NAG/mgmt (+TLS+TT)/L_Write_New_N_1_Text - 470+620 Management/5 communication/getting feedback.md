Test your own views in the form of questions. Let other people help you
smooth and polish your ideas. Use "what do you think of this
suggestion?" Don't be dogmatic.

The higher you go, the more your problems are behavioral.

It could be your expert intuition at work, or maybe it's just a
cognitive bias or other bug. You need to get some feedback: create a
prototype, run some unit tests, and chart some benchmarks. Do what you
need to do to prove that your idea is a good one, because your intuition
may have been wrong.

You need unit tests for yourself, too.

To help get a bigger picture perspective and test your understanding and
mental model, ask yourself something like the following questions:
How do you know?
Says who?
How specifically?
How does what I'm doing cause you to…?
Compared to what or whom?
Does it always happen?
Can you think of an exception?
What would happen if you did (or didn't)?
What stops you from…?
Is there anything you can actually measure?
Get hard numbers on?
Any statistics?

Indians don't admit when they don't understand, because saying they
don't understand would be like saying the person giving instruction did
a bad job.
So, when done, say, "What would you like me to explain again?"

BEST PRACTICES : MANAGEMENT STYLE:
- Encourage Indians to use their own judgement and make their own
    decisions in areas you have delegated to them. They do not always have
    to check with you before acting.
- Encourage Indians to approach your subordinates directly about matters
    you have authorized them to handle. Indians do not have to approach your
    subordinates through you.
- Encourage Indians to question instructions they think are inaccurate
    or wrong, and praise them when they do.
- Encourage Indians to speak up if they know a better way to do something.
- Explain to Indians that you regard them as your equals in the
    relationship, not just hired hands. That you are relying on them to act
    as expert consultants.
- Explain to Indians that you fully expect them to ask questions if they
    have not understood you.
- Instead of asking Indians if they have understood you, volunteer
    additional clarification and see if they accept it.
- Encourage your Indian subordinates to speak up at meetings whenever
    they have something to say.
- Try to praise the whole team, not just one individual.
- Don't be surprised when younger Indians can be very Western in their
    behavior one moment, and very Indian the next.

Coach her employees, "If you see people using our product in a way we
haven't anticipated, let's talk about it."

Seek constant, critical feedback. If you don't know how you're doing, you won't know what to improve. Focus ruthlessly on where you need help.
