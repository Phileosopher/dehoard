
You don't start communities. Communities already exist. They're already doing what they want to do. The question you should ask is how you can help them do that better. Bring them elegant organization.

The key to all platforms is to enable others to use the tool as they wish.

Look at the communities around you. Have you enabled them...
to talk?
to share what they know and need to know?
to support each other?
to do business together?
to socialize?

Be careful. Don't assume these people care about you or think of themselves as members of your community. Don't think that you can create a community. They're not yours.
