[The Ugly Truth About Net Promoter Score Surveys](https://growth.design/case-studies/nps-surveys)
NPS (Net Promoter Score) questions are dubious ways to get feedback
- The "Rate on a scale" method is NOT a good measurement because people often treat the survey requests as spam, and they're easy to "game[game theory]" (Goodhart's Law)
- Incentivizing people doesn't work either, since it leans toward demographics who have lots of time on their hands (and, often, not much money)
- The best way to do it is with focus groups and dialogues with people DIRECTLY experienced with the product, and with no reason to answer one way or another (e.g., free food either way), and it MUST be anonymized to make that happen
- But, if you must have it in text form:
    1. Keep the subject matter concise and to-the-point
    2. Use a human-voiced, short introduction
    3. Have a low-commitment "ask" (e.g., 10 seconds)
    4. Keep VERY few options for the person (e.g., Bad, Okay, Good)
        1. Specify an entirely optional click-through for extra information, if they want to give it
    5. End by specifying clearly why you want the information as well as the level of confidentiality of the information
