Honestly that's all you need to know, but the details are pretty good too. From the April 1 story:

> Industry veteran Beat Zaugg, who has been an owner of Scott Sports since 1998, says he remains the brand's CEO, a minority shareholder and chairman of its parent company board, despite a news release Friday saying that the board had fired him.
> 
> "This announcement was made to destabilize the company and its employees," Zaugg told BRAIN on Monday; he said the announcement had been made via a PR agency that works for Scott's majority shareholder — Korea's Youngone — not Scott Sports. …
> 
> However, the PR firm responded to BRAIN later on Monday with a statement from the Scott Corporation board insisting that Youngone representatives have a majority on the board and had voted to terminate Zaugg.
> 
> "We understand that it may be difficult for Mr. Zaugg to accept his termination (given his long-standing role as CEO). But this is ultimately irrelevant as a matter of law: the ultimate decision body of a company is the board of directors and the board is clearly entitled to terminate the employment with the CEO," the statement read in part. …
> 
> Zaugg conceded that Youngone controls a majority of the board, but said the board did not terminate him correctly. "So far they did it wrong," he told BRAIN, without elaborating. "This has to be my secret for the time being," he said.  

Every dispute of this kind has a paragraph like that: Generally the dispute is between the majority shareholder and the chief executive officer, and the CEO can't usually deny that (1) the majority shareholder owns a majority of the shares and (2) that ultimately gives them the power to fire him. So the CEO is reduced to saying "well, sure they _could_ fire me, but they have to follow proper procedures, and they forgot to send the notice of the board meeting by registered mail so nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah here I still am." Usually the CEO stands on some minor, debatable point of procedure. This is the first time I've seen a CEO stand on a _secret_ point of procedure. I like this guy's style.

Also the April 4 story contains a tantalizing hint that the Swiss police might _regularly_ be involved in disputes like this:

> Fribourg police spokesperson Bertrand Ruffieux told Euro Day France: "Nothing serious happened. We intervened in a civil matter, a dispute between managers. In this type of case, the police are called to the scene to find a way to open a discussion, and for people to understand each other. But there are no injured or anyone arrested."

Like you call the Swiss police and the Corporate Disputes Unit shows up with sirens blaring and they get out the bullhorn and shout "we have a copy of your bylaws right here! Don't do anything rash! A quorum of your board of directors is on the way!"
