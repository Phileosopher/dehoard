  What does it mean to be poor? 
    VoM style is to circle ideas to get to the final point 
    FPU style is to cover cumulative topics 
  Types of poor:
    The poor in control
    The poor that sacrifice to an idol 
    The poor in knowledge 
    The poor in civil liberties 
    The poor in gainful employment 
  Poverty reasons:
    Unemployed 
    Addicted to a substance 
    Working poor from skills 
    Working poor from bad money management 
    Disabled, elderly, widowed or child 
    Oppressed
  if you want to give homeless people money, then you need to Give gift cards instead of money

    If possible, enable them to be self-supporting through working on their own

Rough idea
  what we need isn't as much as we THOUGHT we need:
    e.g. don't need pregnancy clothes, tons of extra paper, etc.
  challenging others by our very existence and what we've gone through:
    make a website?
  why should we help the poor?
  what is poverty?
    it's not homelessness
    it's not necessarily from drugs
    it's the financial obstruction from being self-capable of acquiring needs
      food, water, shelter, phone/internet, toilet paper, medicine, transportation, etc.
    it's sometimes boring (for non-working)
  how does poverty happen?
    (quote Los Angeles survey: 1/3 were substance abusers, 1/3 were mentally unemployable, 1/3 were unlucky)
    it can be from bad life decisions: substance abuse, etc.
      these people need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis
      most of them are addicts, and need addiction recovery (provide links to teen challenge, etc)
    it can be from upbringing
      being mentally unemployable
        often have mental disorders
        have a hard time with stability
        the best solution is to teach them to become small-time entrepreneurs
      lack of understanding sound financial wisdom
        these people need education about sound financial principles
        most of these people aren't aware of the difference between want and need
        debt can magnify these problems by capturing them in slavery (quote proverbs)
    it can be simply circumstantial
      these people might be missionaries, unemployed, divorced or alienated from their previous social group (e.g. mormons)
      many of these are put in the Church to teach the rest of the Body (use verses)
  what happens to people in poverty?
    solitude
      a poor man is alien to even his neighbor (proverbs)
        being poor means being on a lower socioeconomic level, and it creates a feeling of awkwardness, which fosters division
      having a phone is more rare for a poor person, though it's a need for most work
      internet < food, so survival can come at the risk of burning opportunities
    sickness
      can't afford medical stuff
      hygiene and cleaning is more difficult
    vulnerability
      often no shelter
      no ability to legally defend themselves
      with extended solitude, no sufficient network of friends or family
    long-term effects of poverty
      survival-only mentality, loses the ability to think long-term
      loses motivation, feels they can't climb out of it
        even with tons of resources, most people lose the will to look for them
  How do the poor need help?
    how NOT to help
      don't say "be fed and go in peace" (quote James)
      DON'T JUDGE THEM
        they KNOW they screwed up, if they did, you don't need to remind them
        this is the ideological basis for stingy giving, since not all the poor are substance abusers or "nigger rich"
    how to ACTUALLY help
      help the Church
        the rest of the world needs help but you will be known by your love for one another (bible)
        don't rely on tithes, the money rarely makes it to them, rely on word-of-mouth
      give them money, obviously
        use your network and give them a JOB, especially if they are able-bodied or young or intelligent enough
        ONLY restrict money from them if they are a substance abuser or have proven consistent unfaithfulness in managing it
      give them food, but make sure they can cook it and it's not "junk food" that gives more cravings
        often, many poor people don't know how to cook, since they were raised in homes where nobody cooked
      give them first-world needs
        they need a car or a transit pass, depending on where they are
          offer them rides to where they need
        give them shelter
          they need a roof over their head and blankets, but not necessarily air conditioning or heating
        give them connectedness
          pay-as-you-go phones are extremely affordable and solve the need for a phone for work or friendship
          be a friend, they need it more than you do, and you're going to be giving more than taking
        give them special needs
          find ways to provide for specific needs (medical, legal counsel, etc)
      teach them
        thriving is a long-term matter, and most poor people live day-to-day in survival state mentality
        they often don't know how to thrive, simply to survive, so teach them advanced living techniques
          cooking/meal preparation/nutrition
          how to live below their means
          the difference between a want and a need (spectrum)
  what is poverty?
    basic needs can't be personally met through working or paying for it
  how to help the poor:
  food
    any food helps, even if it's weird or near-moldy
  clothing
    this is especially true for poor parents
  hygiene/cleanliness
    this ranges from no cleaning supplies to no access to a shower
    without money, paying for laundry services is expensive
  shelter
    this one is about heat when cold, shade/cool when hot, protection against wind/rain/sun, and storage
    salvation army and others will provide help, but it's often not discipling or helping much else
      it helps more to guide them from placing them in a proper domicile
  medical attention
    often without adequate shelter, this gets worse
    this is especially problematic in the third-world, but is often overlooked in developed nations
  third-world needs
    everything above, but also more opportunities to work and be educated
    water or ready access to water
    electricity
    internet access
    farm equipment/cattle/seeds
  developed world needs
    many basic needs are supplied by government, but many people fall between the cracks:
      single males
      workers below the poverty line
      families without a disabled person
    professional services
      tax preparation
      legal counsel
        wills/estates
        custody of a child
    computer/internet
      can often be supplied by a public library, but depends on their vocational capacity
      necessary for job search
  things that aren't needs
    soda/coffee/tea
    alcohol
    cigarettes
      this is a chemical dependency issue, so some people still need them
      many people trying to kick a worse drug habit will need cigarettes
  why should i help the poor?
    everyone who believes in something bigger than themselves must help the poor
      society is dragged down by it
      the Bible makes it clear (use verses)
      the Quran makes it clear (use verses)
      
    bystander effect makes it where anyone but you won't do it
  how to avoid paternalism
    paternalism actually cripples people, because it enables an entitled state of mind (use Africa aide example)
    ask the constant question: "am i helping them in a way that they could take care of it themselves?"
    when they expect it, stop giving
      don't be afraid to teach them about gratitude, since they may have been RAISED in an entitled culture
    when they abuse the privilege, stop giving
      many people don't realize how much support they really receive, and it's wise to let them reap what they sow if they presume it to always be there

  how to help addicts
    make sure you understand (what an addict is)
    addicts have an obsession where everyone is substance-provider, substance-inhibitor or irrelevant
    [give the 12 steps]
    they need to perform Step 1, or else everything helping them is simply enabling
    often many people who "help the poor" to their disadvantage like this are actually addicts themselves (to people, to being needed, etc)
  what an addict is
    physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance, and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects
    anything can become an addiction, and it will show itself based on how much that person is trying to upkeep it/maintain it/lives for it
    list many possible addictions
      chemically addictive things
      psychologically addictive things (non-chemical)
      socially permissible addictions
    link at bottom to HOW TO HELP ADDICTS
  how to support helpers
    if a group, look at the group's admin/support ratio
    if a person, look at their needs
    the ways to help:
      financial
        use any variety of fundraising techniques (pull from tPA)
        give up your wants to fufill your Christian siblings' needs
          entertainment
          possessions you have
          pampering your pet
          social status clubs and indulgent recreational activities
      emotional
        they're not invincible, and they spend most of their time around people that need THEM, so provide for their needs
      word-of-mouth
        even if you don't have any money, try to promote them whenever you can among others who can donate
  how to help the helpless
    many people CAN work, but these people are incapable of working:
      mental retardation
      elderly
      physical disability (stroke, injury, etc)
    as much as possible, a lot of dignity can come from them helping out in small ways
    provide for their needs in a way that doesn't expect anything in return
      physical needs
      love and overflowing affection for them, compassion, kindness
  what work is
    it gives value to a person from accomplishing something
    it doesn't have to be huge, simply challenging and effective
    links to tPA (productivity, success)
  sound financial principles
    link to tPA (money), format is generally tPA's
    this may be difficult, but teach them the benefits before anything else:
      getting a "pay raise"
      more security and safety
    this WILL be a lifestyle change, so it will likely hurt
      they need to be motivated to change for their own benefit

    avoid preaching at them
    try to use your own network connections (85% of available jobs are never posted)
