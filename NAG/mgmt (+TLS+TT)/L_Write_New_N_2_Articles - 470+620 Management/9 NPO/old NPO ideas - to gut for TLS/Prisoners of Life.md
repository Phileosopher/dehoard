Things to teach them
  They're doing things that destroy themselves
  It's a mirror effect because most people are ONLY self interested
  We still need love and nurture, even though we've been screwed in the past to where we don't want to believe or accept it
  Sometimes, that unwillingness is subconscious, meaning we do things that float back and forth
  Nobody sees what you think, just what you do
  Unfortunately, what we do is the LAST part of a multi stage process, which our environment tells us is good or bad
  We're all a product of our responses to our environment
  Everyone I'm talking to had a bad environment they're coming out of

Things to give the people
  JOB resources
  What to do with constraints like prison or social anxiety, tailored to personality
  How to connect with others
  Integrating into society
  Deciding what social group to associate with

Is it coaching or mentoring?
  Mentoring is in-depth and involved, while coaching is broad and quick
  Probably both, but coaching is the events while mentoring is the one-on-one

Maybe make a temp agency/incubator?

Make a step-by-step program for EVERYONE
  Kinda like the 12 steps?

Make a list of EVERYTHING in a broad sense that people need to do to be functional members of society
  Maintain a house (clean, minor repairs)
  Cook for themselves
  Work a career-paying job
    A entrepreneurship
      Creativity/tenacity
      Diligence/faith
    B employee
      Submission/subservience
      Adaptability to others' standards
      Humility
  Be involved in a club or recreational activity
  Maintain personal hygiene
  Save money by living below their means
  Understand the difference between want and need
  Avoid excess in alcohol/drugs and staying clean
  Knowing where to go to find like-minded healthy people
  Knowing how to connect passion into hobbies/work

Idea: relate the black market version of things to its legal equivalent
  gang member can become an employee
  drug dealing can close a deal
  holding up a liquor store can start a business

Create a business plan to sell it to potential board members
  Do
    Write clearly, using simple and easy-to-understand language.

    Include relevant graphs and program descriptions.
    Include an executive summary.
    Provide sufficient financial information.
    Customize your business plan to different audiences.
    Stay authentic and show enthusiasm.
  Don't
    Make the business plan too long.

    Overload the plan with text.
    Rush the process of writing, but don't drag it either.
    Gush about the cause without providing a clear understanding of how you will help the cause through your activities.
  Format
    Keep your formatting consistent.
    Use standard 1-inch margins.
    Use a reasonable font size for the body, such as 12 points.
    For print, use a serif font like Times New Roman or Courier. For digital, use sans serifs like Verdana or Arial.
    Do start a new page before each section.
    Don't allow your plan to print and leave a single line on an otherwise blank page.
    Have several people read over the plan before it is printed to make sure it's totally error-free.

Create the organization's bylaws
  Comprehensive bylaws to govern your operations are a central element of responsible nonprofit management, and they're also required for receiving tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status.
  Work with your nonprofit's leadership team to draft a set of founding bylaws. They should directly address, but aren't limited to, these topics and elements of how your organization will work:
    Clearly defined leadership and staff roles
    A formal mission statement
    Donation solicitation protocols
    Membership program and committee structures
    Policies for resolving conflicts of interest, setting compensation, etc.
    Procedures for amending the bylaws
    Explicitly defined financial reporting protocols
  It's important to draft and vote on a set of bylaws early in the process of starting your nonprofit for two reasons: It's a required part of the federal 501(c)(3) application, and it sets a strong precedent.

Alter that business plan to sell it to potential donors

Legally incorporate (necessary for 501(c)3 status)
  In addition to your founding bylaws, there's another important document you'll need to draft before moving on with starting your nonprofit: your official charter.
  Officially incorporating your nonprofit is required for eventually receiving 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, accepting donations, and essentially functioning as a legal nonprofit organization.
  Sounds intimidating, but creating and filing nonprofit articles of incorporation is actually one of the easiest steps in the entire process. Do some quick research on your state's nonprofit laws, then simply complete the incorporation document with the following information:
  Legally incorporating your organization is essential for starting a nonprofit.
    The legal name of your organization
    The official location of its operations
    The names and addresses of all initial trustees, or board members
  Each official board member identified in your bylaws then needs to sign the articles of incorporation. Submit this document to your state's secretary of state office, and you've legally incorporated your nonprofit organization!
  Of course, this process varies slightly state by state, so do your research before starting. For more specific guidance, check out this handy template from the IRS that can guide your team as you draft your own founding charter.

Get grant-writing
  Nonprofit grant writing can be a major challenge. This is particularly true in the earliest days of your organization.
  However, finding and applying for nonprofit startup grants is also extremely important. Without some initial funding, it can be difficult to reach and engage with the donors who will support your work in the future.
  Start by researching the different sources and types of nonprofit startup grants.
  As you start a nonprofit, you should actively research funding and grant opportunities.
  Next, familiarize your team with the grant writing process. If most or all members of your team are new to grant writing, doing some research beforehand will go a long way toward boosting your chances of success. Put generally, the steps of grant writing are:
    Understand your goals.
    Identify grant opportunities and research the sources.
    Build a grant writing team.
    Get started on the proposal, refining your strategy as you go.
    Build a strong case for support.
    Review and submit.
  This is a minimal version of the grant writing process, but there are plenty of resources out there that can give you a much fuller understanding of how to write a winning grant proposal.
  Securing some initial funding early on is the best way for your nonprofit to start pursuing its mission. Continue researching and applying for startup grant funds as you work on the next step, too.
  Tip: Depending on the specifics of the grant application, you may want to highlight how your nonprofit is using technology to meet its goals. As appropriate, include your text-to-give number and keyword, as well as a link to your online donation page. Show how you're engaging, expanding, and unleashing generosity!
