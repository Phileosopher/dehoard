That said, the idea is not a bad one. Good investment bankers understand that, while their client is the _company_, the path to a good client relationship runs through befriending and helping out the company's _executives_. Sometimes this means helping them out with good corporate-finance ideas that will impress the board or their bosses, but other times it means helping them out in their personal capacity. Classically this means taking them golfing. Sometimes it means referring executives to new jobs, which can be good for the new employer and also make the executive more loyal to the banker. And sometimes hooking an executive up with a really good private wealth adviser — if you happen to have one — _is_ good client service. The question is just how confident the investment bankers are that their bank's private wealth managers are really good ones.

Bloomberg's Heather Perlberg [caught up a while back](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35377662.266794/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjQtMDUtMTQvZHJleGVsLXMtZG9uLWVuZ2VsLWhhcy1kaWVkLWhpcy10YWxlcy1vZi13YWxsLXN0cmVldC13b21lbi1hbmQtd2VhbHRoLWxpdmUtb24_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDUxNDI0X01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjQwNTE0JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60e87ce39a995a4b1a2deb96B8ea73d61) with Don Engel, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert investment banker who died earlier this year. He seems to have specialized in winning corporate financing business by helping executives in their personal capacity:

> Engel was quick to admit that he was never one of the financial brains at Drexel. He worked in the corporate finance department but he didn't have an MBA. What he did have, however, was an almost preternatural sense for what clients really wanted. That sense, Engel insisted, could be at times more useful than numbers and business school case studies ever could. CEOs have lonely jobs, he told me. So, he set out to become a kind of therapist-in-residence at Drexel — the guy CEOs and corporate raiders could turn to in confidence to talk through personal problems. Marriages and affairs, current or prospective, were usually at the top of the list. …
> 
> "In most cases, the CEO has no one to talk to," Engel said. "He can't tell people what's going on with his wife, with his girlfriend. He can't tell them about what's going on with his mistress.''
> 
> He went on: "He is imploding, and there I am, because I understand all this. So then, once you start to understand that person, then you have a relationship. And that's what I did best."

If your investment banking job consists of talking to CEOs about their mistresses, might you also get into the ancillary business of referring potential mistresses to the executives? Engel absolutely did, is the point of the rest of the article.

it's legitimately lonely at the top
- when that happens, you can only survive if you either have no morals or get out of the grindbox
- this is NOT easy, and it can slowly TURN us into Cluster B if we stay there too long
