Accountants

Well I think accounting is cool. Accounting, like tax law or Ancient Greek, has this pleasing constellation of features:

    It is an arcane and detailed body of knowledge, so if you have a detail-oriented, trivia-loving cast of mind, you might enjoy it, and if you become good at it people will be impressed at all the random stuff you know.
    But it’s not random. Despite the arcana, it is a fundamentally principled body of knowledge: The rules fit together in a largely sensible way to achieve some core goals. In accounting, the basic goals include accurately and usefully presenting a company’s financial position, accurately reflecting changes in that position, etc.
    It is a social body of knowledge: Accounting rules are made by committees based on human experiences; they are not given facts of the natural world. Understanding people helps you understand accounting, and vice versa.
    If you understand the principles deeply and study all the arcana, you can find little glitches, little places where the actual rules can be used to accomplish things that seem to contradict the deep principles. In tax law, the glitches tend to have the form “make income disappear.” In accounting, the glitches tend to have the form “make income appear out of nowhere.” Finding those glitches is a satisfying intellectual endeavor and a way to demonstrate to yourself that you have truly mastered both the principles and the details.
    Also, if you are good at finding those glitches, you can turn them into a lot of money. (This does not work with Ancient Greek.)

Does that sound appealing to you? Probably most of you are saying “what, no,” and a substantial minority of you are like “yes, that does sound cool, that is pretty much what I do in my job as a [derivatives structurer][distressed credit investor][software engineer][fintech founder][financial fraudster], though I probably get paid more than the accountants,” and a few of you are like “I am an accountant and that doesn’t sound all that much like my day job,” and then one of you is going to email me to be like “I am an accountant at a Big Four national office and thank you for appreciating my art.”

But a lot of 18-year-olds will start college soon and they all think accounting is boring, so there is a dire shortage of accountants. At Business Insider, Emmalyse Brownstein reports:

    Accountants have become an endangered species, and that's endangering the financial ecosystem. But bolstering their ranks is no easy feat.

    "The pay is crappy, the hours are long, and the work is drudgery," said Richard Rampell, a retired accountant in South Florida. "And the drudgery is especially so in their early years." …

    Gen Z is also, notably, the first generation to have truly grown up with social media. They spent their childhoods watching a stream of what everyone else does with their lives, and many have become convinced that that's much better than whatever they're doing with their own. In this way, social media has incentivized them to focus on doing things their peers deem interesting or exciting. And, well, accounting isn't readily Instagrammable.

    Then there's the double-whammy problem of becoming an accountant, which is both harder to achieve and pays less than other finance jobs. A CPA candidate usually needs to get a master's in accounting to satisfy the requirement that they take 150 credit hours. After that comes the CPA exam: four grueling four-hour tests that must be passed within 18 months. And before they can officially get the title, candidates need to spend a year working under a licensed CPA. …

    Students can get higher-paying and arguably more exciting finance jobs right out of college without doing all that.

I mean, fair; I enjoyed dabbling in accounting as a derivatives structurer but I didn’t go and become a CPA or anything. There are some obvious fixes, including “pay them more,” “easing the 150-credit-hours requirement” and making accounting classes cooler:

    The way accounting is taught could also help stanch the shortage, [New York University accounting professor Amal] Shehata said. "It's up to us as academics to make the curriculum exciting and interesting," she said. "To me, that means it's relevant and it's timely." For example, she recently taught a class about the intersection of the blockchain and accounting.

The kids these days, they love blockchains. And:

    The report's suggestions included "placing highly engaging instructors" in those classes, "incorporating gamification and other technology" to "stoke engagement and demonstrate the vital role technology plays in the accounting profession," and exposing students to "more real-life accounting practitioners in a range of career vocations."

I kind of love the idea of gamifying introductory accounting education? It is probably not the case that every accountant should be trained to think of accounting as a game that they can win, but the ones who are trained that way can probably have a lot of tun.
