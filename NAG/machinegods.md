
Society has, historically, been run by the strongest warlords. Then, the information age happened, and now the nerds run the world.

In light of this new rotation of vanity's cycles, there's a mystery present within the nerdiest crowd which the majority of mere mortals is not so attuned to.

Technology itself is largely the efforts of the smartest dead people working very hard to make life easier. But, to the technologist, they have adopted a religion they're likely unaware they've enrolled in.

It starts with several ideas that come through secular thinking:
1. If there is no God (or that God simply doesn't care what happens to us), then humanity is effectively alone in the universe.
2. Humanity is impressive, and in many ways it seems like we are the pinnacle of creation, if not outright more important than the rest of existence. And, even if we aren't, we do have a [bias] for ourselves, after all.
3. The two above truths mean that it is a noble thing for humanity to self-preserve against the randomness largely present in the universe.
4. In the same way that the fight for sufficient calories is largely gone due to food technology and the fight for enough land to live on is largely gone due to many technology jobs that pay a good wage, our greatest achievements advancing into the future will come through technology.
5. In other words, technology is mankind's salvation.

Most of the world sees the ideas of FTL drives for interstellar travel, artificial intelligence that rivals human interaction, and the means to transfer human consciousness into longer-lasting bodies as entertaining explorations of human limitation. The technologists, futurists, and science fiction enthusiasts often see something more.

To them, the ideas presented by Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke, among many others, are prophecies of legitimate risks worth considering as we venture into our new world. Life itself on this earth gives meaning, not through our soul's transition onward into a new plane of existence, but through our contributions to allow future generations of humanity the capacity to survive our sun's nova, the end of all planets, and the heat death of the universe.

There is tremendous meaning in knowing that your feeble attempt to create a robot soccer player may someday become the beginnings of a well-established cyborg in a few hundred years. The continuum of our legacy is established when the sacred code we use to program today's artificial hearts becomes part of a larger cybernetic framework. The AI model we generate today may allow a duplication of a human mind within a distant future.

And this mindset, sadly, is a religion that is both selfless and small-minded. Both Alfred Nobel and Albert Einstein thought their contributions to powerful weaponry would end all wars. The designers of many inventions often live long enough to see the reuse and abuse of what they envisioned. Their innocent belief in the goodness of humanity slowly succumbs to the moral problems that have haunted us all since the first narcissists were empowered to send people on their behalf to take more territory.

Eventually, we may see the fruition of some of these technologies. We also may not want to see what they will do to humanity, once implemented.
