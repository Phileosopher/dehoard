Definitions of chemistry:
- the study of matter and its changes (a philosophical assertion that orders substances based on changes)
- the science that investigates the molecular rasons for the processes occurring in our macroscopic world - Nivaldo J Tro (an atomized version that explains the larger things)
- the study of the material metamorphosis of materials - August Kekule (another philosophical assertion, but focuses more on changes instead of the substances)

Chemistry is a central science (see photo), and it serves as a bridge between physics and biology, which are also both central sciences
- it's a spectrum between physics and biology
- physics represents fundamental things, and biology represents complex things
- A Physical chemistry - physics and math that give theories
- B inorganic chemistry - non-carbon-based chemistry, metals, semiconductor materials
- C organic chemistry - carbon-based chemistry, which typically involves bonding with hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen
  - tremendous variety with those 4 bases
  - it was originally living things, but has now expanded to carbon in general
- D biochemistry - chemical structures and reactions involving life processes, the newest discipline
- META: analytical chemistry - measurement techniques, how much to quantify, how much to measure

3 different domains of chemistry
1 macroscopic
2 microscopic
3 symbolic - representation of chemical components
