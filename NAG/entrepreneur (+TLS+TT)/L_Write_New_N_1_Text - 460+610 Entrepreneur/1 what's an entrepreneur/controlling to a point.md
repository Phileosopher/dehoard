Buffett has not merely bought some shares of a company he likes, but
instead has acquired a controlling interest.

Buffett enhanced the value of his investments by becoming an active
member of the board of directors.

He began buying entire businesses near the beginning of his stint as a
money manager, long before his assets were great enough

He did not immerse himself in day-to-day operations. By and large,
Buffett relies on strong managers who share his passion for return on
investment.

Kerkorian lost his investment. He resolved not to invest thereafter in a
business he did not run.

If there was a charity doing something I thought was so important that I
should donate a substantial amount of my own money to it, I'd be doing
that work myself.
