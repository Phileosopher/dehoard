Many people network too much. It's tough to make money. It's not a party.

Every day think of at least two people to introduce to each other who
will help each other.

Pick your social media outlet, master it.

HOW TO GET RICH
- Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.
    - The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet.
- business partners should have intelligence, purposefulness and integrity
- Arm yourself with specific knowledge, public accountability, and leverage.
    - Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.
    - The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.
- Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
    - Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
    - Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
    - An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.
    - If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.
    - Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.
    - Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.
