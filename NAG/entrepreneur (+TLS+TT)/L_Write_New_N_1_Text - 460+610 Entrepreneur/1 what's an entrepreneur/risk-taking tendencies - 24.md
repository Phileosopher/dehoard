- you often can't know the kinds of trouble you'll be involved in beforehand
- many times, it becomes a battle of legality, and your [legal safety] only partly protects you
- this legal risk is an additional occupational burden on the modern entrepreneur, on top of the financial/career risks

In business, as in life, you can't afford to be afraid of doing the wrong thing.

Innovation is what you get when you capitalise on luck, when you get up from behind your desk and go and see where ideas and people lead you.

If you want swashbuckling action in your life, become an entrepreneur and give it a go.
Learn the art of trying to set up your own business.
Which is the same as saying, learn the art of making mistakes and learning lessons.

You could have 100% of the equity if you fully fund your own venture, but if it fails you'll have 100% of nothing. Owning just 0.01% of Google, by contrast, is incredibly valuable (more than $35 million now.)

My definition of a startup: a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

Entrepreneurs trapped in this system may prosper through general growth
in the economy, but they will not become fabulously wealthy. To pull out
of the pack, they must earn much higher profits than the economy as a
whole is generating. In short, if you hope to become a billionaire, you
must overcome the scourge of competition, one way or another.
- risk is ABSOLUTELY necessary, mostly because others are [terrified] of taking those risks, which leaves an [economic] gap of decreased supply

Proactive behavior is one common theme to watch for as you read the
following sketches of champion bargain hunters. Observe as well the two
distinct ways in which billionaires squeeze pennies until they scream.
Not only do they pay as little as possible for the assets they buy, but
they relentlessly strive to reduce the operating costs of their properties.

Buying when others appear to be panicking sometimes proves nothing
except that there was good reason to panic.

Many entrepreneurs take a "just do it" attitude, avoiding all forms of management, process, and discipline. Unfortunately, this approach leads to chaos more often than it does to success.

Entrepreneurship requires a managerial discipline to harness the entrepreneurial opportunity.

Starting a business is often an act of desperation. Entrepreneurs are desperate for success and accomplishment. Desperation pushes us to take huge risks, leave comfort and security behind, and allow a business to consume our lives.

Decide whether you belong in the game.

I'm not a gambler. Professional poker players approach the game as a business. They recognize that gambling is bad for business.

to gamble is to rely on luck instead of facts. The professionals cash in by waiting for gamblers to come along.

wait until you have great cards before playing, so your odds of winning aremuch better than those of people who play every hand they are dealt. In business, this practice translates as being conservative. For instance, opening up a franchise might be a smarter move than starting a company from scratch.

It's far more dangerous to fly too low than too high, because it feels safe to fly low.

We shortchange not only ourselves but also those who might benefit from our work.

Figure out how to realign your comfort zone with today's new safety zone,

Commit to the frightening work of flying blind, of taking a stand, and of making something new, complex, and vital.

What's scarce is trust, connection, and surprise.

Better sorry than safe.
