To perform like a champion, you also have to outflank thousands of
competitors who are perspiring every bit as profusely as you are. To
avoid being leveled out with the rest of them, you must do something
different. You have to contemplate bigger risks, try unorthodox business
strategies, or raise the ante in making deals. It is all right to copy
someone else's idea, but you have to execute it better. Ordinary efforts
and conventional approaches do not produce extraordinary wealth.
