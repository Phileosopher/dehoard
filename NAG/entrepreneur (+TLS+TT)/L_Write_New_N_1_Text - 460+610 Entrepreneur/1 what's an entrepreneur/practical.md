
In science, belief is literal belief; it is right or wrong, never metaphorical.
In real life, belief is an instrument to do things, not the end product.
This is similar to vision: the purpose of your eyes is to orient you in the best possible way, and get you out of trouble when needed, or help you find prey at a distance.
Your eyes are not sensors designed to capture the electromagnetic spectrum. Their job description is not to produce the most accurate scientific representation of reality; rather the most useful one for survival.

Survival comes first;
Truth, understanding, and science later.
There is no such thing as the "rationality" of a belief, there is rationality of action.
The rationality of an action can be judged only in terms of evolutionary considerations.
What is rational is that which allows for survival.
