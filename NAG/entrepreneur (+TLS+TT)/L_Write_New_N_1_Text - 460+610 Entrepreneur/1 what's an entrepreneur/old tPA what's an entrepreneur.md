
### Entrepreneurs always sell when they're not creating

An owner constantly maintains customers
- Perpetually and tenaciously looks for new customers
- Uses every form of conventional and guerilla [marketing](http://philosaccounting.com/a/the-colors-of-the-mind/)
- Keeps customers with trustworthiness, character, and [happiness](http://philosaccounting.com/a/how-to-be-happy/)

Sells by focusing exclusively on customer needs and wants
- Ignore what the customer feels
- Ignore what potential customers think outside your marketing focus
- Focus on the image you sell the product or service as and not what it is
- [Focus on your target market](http://philosaccounting.com/a/the-colors-of-the-mind/) and consider adapting product lines for them
- You must understand and observe your market's economic movement and fluctuations

Fully clarify terms of any service agreement before customers sign it
- A customer could [sue you](http://philosaccounting.com/a/how-to-stay-out-of-court/) for any damages
- Without their awareness, a customer could negotiate you to work for free
