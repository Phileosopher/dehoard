more until they emerge with terms that satisfy him.

"A deal," Huizenga once told an interviewer, with a smile, "it's like
chasing a girl. You work at it until she says yes."

Laurence Tisch's immense wealth derives mainly from buying low and
selling high.
Observers commonly overlook the negotiating skill that has enabled him
to obtain bargains that otherwise might have gone to his rivals.
A typical assessment runs along these lines:
To triumph as often as he has, Tisch has thumbed his nose at
conventional wisdom. He buys companies or stocks when they are wildly
unpopular and shuns anything that is remotely in vogue.
In many such comments over the years, the press has celebrated Tisch's
knack for finding value, while obscuring his effectiveness in adding value.

There are several different ways to realize value in buying and selling
businesses.
Negotiating favorable prices, both on the way in and on the way out, is
only the most obvious.
Another means of maximizing the gain on the round trip is to finance the
purchase on advantageous terms.
Further gains are achievable from increasing the asset's value,
following its purchase, through capable management.
Not to be ignored, either, is the compensation that can be extracted
during the ownership/management phase.
By exploiting all these profit sources in every transaction, and by
doing many transactions, it is possible to amass a sizable fortune.
Identifying the opportunities requires a keen sense of where the deals
are at a given time.
Clues can be found in the economic environment, the state of the capital
markets, and conditions in various industries.
Essential to astute deal making, as well, is a grasp of complex
transactions in which one side may wind up with a subtle, but ultimately
decisive, edge.

Tenacity, willingness to risk a huge loss, and creativity in forging
agreements are recurring themes.

Wayne Huizenga's creation of Waste Management:
In acquiring independent waste haulers, he minimized the haggling over
price by beginning at a level within 5 or 10 percent of the maximum that
he would pay.
Then, he would focus the discussion on such issues as the tax benefits
of taking Waste Management stock in payment and the seller's ongoing
relationship as an operator.

Wayne was famous for, "Do the deal now for $100, do it tomorrow for $90."

Huizenga sought to get deals completed quickly. His team would begin
negotiating on Monday morning and work 18 hours a day, seven days a
week, until the transaction closed.
He stuck rigorously to two rules:
Wayne Huizenga's Cardinal Rules for Closing Deals
1. Don't lose a deal by failing to pay attention to it
2. Never talk about a deal until it is signed

Deal making on the scale that produces billionaires requires nerves of
steel. At one time or another, the three superb negotiators profiled in
this chapter have all been in tight spots, facing potential bankruptcy.
If they did not enjoy the rush of adrenaline that accompanies a
successful deal, they could not have pursued the deal maker's route to
massive wealth accumulation. To replicate their success, you too will
have to learn to love the deals for their own sake.

The impetus behind Kirk Kerkorian's success has been his restlessness.
The wide variety of businesses he has engaged in supports his claim that
he started out with no specific ambition.
"I just tend to get dissatisfied easily and want to do something else,"
he once explained.
Day-to-day operations hold little appeal for him, but buying and selling
companies clearly does, even when incumbent management fights him tooth
and nail.

It was impossible to deal with Icahn. Every time he thought he had
reached an agreement, Icahn would come back to the negotiating table
with a new wrinkle or a revised number that altered the terms radically
in his favor. He delighted in extracting one wage concession after another.

Phil is very astute in analyzing what it is that is going to be the next
most important business or marketplace. He takes advantage of his assets
in ways most other people don't.

Like most successful deal makers, Anschutz showed a keen eye for value
from his earliest days. He was only 27 when he learned of a collection
of western art in the basement of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
Railway's Chicago headquarters. The railroad had originally commissioned
the paintings as models for travel posters. Managing to gain an
interview with the company's chairman, Anschutz offered to catalog the
largely forgotten works in exchange for the right to purchase a few. The
85 paintings that he bought for a song a few days later were eventually
valued at several million dollars.

"It's important to have your back to the wall," Phil Anschutz commented,
recollecting the oil-field fire. "It teaches you how to think outside
the box."

Sheer determination has been a consistent theme of the marathon runner's
long-run success in amassing wealth.
