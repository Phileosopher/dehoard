
Definition of what makes a good entrepreneur by Paul Graham - relentlessly resourceful

Torchbearers often attract a crowd. People are fascinated by individuals who are willing to carry responsibility.
Torchbearers don't realize how unique they are, how powerful their role is, or how difficult their task is.
Torchbearers care more about forward motion than they do which route to take. Won't find them looking for perfect solutions in meetings.
Torchbearers don't stop until they finish. Balance between devotion to duty and the pursuit of joy. A torchbearer never forgets about or shortchanges a duty, even when that means postponing joy.

Buffett downplays the importance of IQ in material success, stressing
instead the importance of character and drive.
Fair enough, but there are several different proven strategies for
turning those traits into billion-dollar fortunes. Not all of them
require exceptional intellectual capacity.
To the extent that Buffett's success has relied on discerning superior
values among stocks being scrutinized by millions of other investors, on
the other hand, brainpower has been an invaluable asset.
This is a fact worth considering as you try to match your own talents to
a specific strategy for reaching the billion-dollar circle.

Everyone is an entrepreneur. The only skills you need to be an
entrepreneur are the ability to fail, to have ideas, to sell those
ideas, to execute on them, and to be persistent so even as you fail you
learn and move onto the next adventure.
- BASICALLY, YOU'RE AN ENTREPRENEUR IF YOU TAKE A RISK, THOUGH IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE A CAREER PATHWAY

Build trust while you sleep. Honesty compounds over years and decades.
More people trust your word and spread the news that you are a person to
be sought out, sought after, given opportunity, given help, or given money.
- HIGH-CONSCIENTIOUSNESS

The essence of an entrepreneur is the die-hard belief that we are the only one able to make things happen.
