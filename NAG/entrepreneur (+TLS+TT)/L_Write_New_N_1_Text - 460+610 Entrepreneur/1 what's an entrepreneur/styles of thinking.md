VENTURE CAPITALISTS STYLES OF THINKING:

"Art Critics"
assessed entrepreneurs almost at a glance, the way an art critic can
assess the quality of a painting - intuitively and based on long experience.

"Sponges"
took more time gathering information about their targets, soaking up
whatever they could from interviews, on-site visits, references, and the
like. Then they went with whatever their guts told them. As one such
investor told Smart, he did "due diligence by mucking around."

"Prosecutors"
interrogated entrepreneurs aggressively, testing them with challenging
questions about their knowledge and how they would handle random
hypothetical situations.

"Suitors"
focused more on wooing people than on evaluating them.

"Terminators"
saw the whole effort as doomed to failure and skipped the evaluation
part. They simply bought what they thought were the best ideas, fired
entrepreneurs they found to be incompetent, and hired replacements.

"Airline Captains."
took a methodical, checklist-driven approach to their task. Studying
past mistakes and lessons from others in the field, they built formal
checks into their process. They forced themselves to be disciplined and
not to skip steps, even when they found someone they "knew" intuitively
was a real prospect.

Smart next tracked the venture capitalists' success over time. There was
no question which style was most effective - and by now you should be
able to guess which one. It was the Airline Captain.
The Airline Captains had a median 80 percent return on the investments
studied, the others 35 percent or less.

Smart published his findings more than a decade ago. He has since gone
on to explain them in a best-selling business book on hiring called Who.

When young people who "want to help mankind" come to me asking, "What should I do? I want to reduce poverty, save the world," my suggestion is:
1) Never engage in virtue signaling
2) Never engage in rent-seeking
3) You must start a business.
Put yourself on the line, start a business. Yes, take risk, and if you get rich (which is optional), spend your money generously on others.
