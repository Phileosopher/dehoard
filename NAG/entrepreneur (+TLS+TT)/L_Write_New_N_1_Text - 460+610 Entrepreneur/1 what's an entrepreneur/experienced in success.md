An entrepreneur who'd failed in a previous venture was not likely to do
better than someone who'd never run a business in her life.

Successful entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are 50 percent more likely
to succeed in a second venture. The more you win, the more likely you
are to win again.

Looks like the advice of "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" and
"failure makes you wiser" isn't actually true.
