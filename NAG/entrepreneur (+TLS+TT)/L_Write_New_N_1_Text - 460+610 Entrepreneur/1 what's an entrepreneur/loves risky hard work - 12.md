
It's really hard, and you have to do it over a sustained period of time, so if you don't love it, if you aren't having fun doing it, and you don't really love it, you're going to give up.

If you don't love it, you're going to fail.

Elon Musk said that starting a company is like "staring into the abyss and eating glass."

"Looking for my passion" is just an excuse in disguise. We use it to cover up for the fact that we're not progressing, growing, and taking action in life.

What about Bono, Branson, or Oprah? If you saw their schedules - the day in, day out demands they are under, and the pressure they shoulder - you wouldn't think what they do 95 percent of the time is that great at all. The rest of their days are spent in endless meetings, negotiations, contract reviews, lawsuits, makeup chairs, rehearsals, travel, and transportation.

I don't care what you do, it's going to suck most of the time. Tell yourself, "This work is going to suck 95 percent of the time."

I do not love what I do. But I sure as heck love why I do it. I am passionate about my mission of empowering entrepreneurs.

Bring passion to how you do even the most (seemingly) mundane tasks. I've seen mechanics, gardeners, toll takers, cab drivers, project managers, CPAs, lawyers, and CEOs execute the "hows" of their work with great passion and joy. Their passion was in the quality of the activity, the execution, and the outcome.

Refocus your mind and attention on who is being served by what you do, why and how you do it.

Being successful in business requires an emotional charge.

If that charge comes from your desire to right a wrong, fight the good fight, or seek justice, then it's just as good as love and often even better.

Products or companies that bear the owner's name convey very valuable messages. They are shouting that they have something to lose. Eponymy indicates both a commitment to the company and a confidence in the product.
