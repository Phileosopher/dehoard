
Once the entrepreneur has the company up and running, they often need to pass the baton on to the manager.
The creator's job is to find someone with expertise who understands the vision and is prepared to follow the path.
The entrepreneur's job is effectively to put themselves out of a job each time the new company is up and running.
Then they can step aside and free themselves up to be entrepreneurial in a different business.
It is generally asking for trouble for an entrepreneur to stick around for too long, trying to cover both roles.
In a small business, you can be both the entrepreneur and the manager while you are getting it going.
But you need to know and understand everything about that business. And I really mean everything.
An emerging entrepreneur should sign every cheque.
Examine every invoice, and you'll soon appreciate where your money is going.
Even in a big business like the Virgin Group, I sit down now and again and sign every single cheque that goes out, and I ask my managing directors to do the same. For a month. Sign everything for a month every six months and suddenly you're asking: 'What on earth is this for?' You'll be able to cut out unnecessary expenditure quite dramatically when you do that.
As a small-business person, you must immerse yourself 100 per cent in everything and learn about the ins and outs of every single department.
As you get bigger, you will be able to delegate, and when people come to you with their problems, they'll be surprised how knowledgeable you are and how much practical advice you can offer.
The reason you're knowledgeable is because in the early days of the business, you learned all about it.
This is how business leadership is achieved. There are no short cuts.

If you're an entrepreneur, you need to find a manager. Then you should move on, enjoy yourself and then set up your next enterprise.
