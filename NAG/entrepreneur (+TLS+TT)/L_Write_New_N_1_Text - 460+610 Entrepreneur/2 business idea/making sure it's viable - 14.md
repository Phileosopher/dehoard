
Creating value is not enough - you also need to capture some of the value you create.

When you hear that most new restaurants fail within one or two years, your instinct will be to come up with a story about how yours is different. You'll spend time trying to convince people that you are exceptional instead of seriously considering whether that's true.

In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything. Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can't.

Only monopoly profits allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival.

Unless you have perfectly conventional beliefs, it's rarely a good idea to tell everybody everything that you know.
- EXPECT YOUR IDEA, UPON BEING SHARED, TO HAVE A TIMER START SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD UNTIL IT ACTUALIZES
- IT MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY PRESENT, BUT YOUR IDEA, IF NEW, BECOMES THE START OF A [TREND]

So who do you tell? Whoever you need to, and no more. In practice, there's always a golden mean between telling nobody and telling everybody - and that's a company. The best entrepreneurs know this: every great business is built around a secret that's hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirator.

Franchising is risky
- You must consider the [contract] carefully: they might make money when you don't, or may charge you to keep going.
- Careful with competition: you're ALSO competing with the other franchisees.

Pay very VERY close attention to risk vectors
- narrow your scope of operations to avoid exposing yourself to too many competitive elements at once
- in a globalized, interdependent society, rando foreigners who can work for a fraction of your wage have an edge on you

The greatest rewards come from working on something that nobody has a name for. If you possibly can, work where there are no words for what you do.

If we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is.

The one thing that matters most in determining whether your business succeeds or fails miserably is sales. The ultimate success of a product or service is 10 percent product quality and 90 percent sales.

Project/Product confusion:
A project is a software application that you build as a fun side project. The end result is a neat little application that likely isn't of use to many people.
A product is a project that people will pay money for.

The single most important factor to a product's success is not the founders, not the marketing effort, and certainly not the product. It's whether there's a group of people willing to pay for it.

Building something no one wants is the most common source of failure for entrepreneurs.
