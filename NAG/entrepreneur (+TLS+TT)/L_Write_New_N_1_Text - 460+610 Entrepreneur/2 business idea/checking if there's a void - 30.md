
We carefully research the Achilles heels of different global industries, and only when we feel we can potentially turn an industry on its head, and fulfil our key role as the consumer's champion, do we move in on it.

PaulGraham - Here is why I received so much criticism: I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.

The marketplace is theoretically the best mechanism for matching supply with demand, establishing prices, and extracting maximum utility from finite resources. So why don't all individuals act as individual buyers and sellers, rather than gather in companies with tens of thousands of coworkers?

Compelling high resolution images have become ubiquitous, yet professional photo agencies treat them like a scarce resource. (iStockPhoto changes that equation)

What valuable company is nobody building?

Our contrarian question: what important truth do very few people agree with you on?

Contrarian thinking doesn't make any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.

The business version of our contrarian question: What valuable company is nobody building? Every correct answer is necessarily a secret.

Something important and unknown, something hard to do but doable.

Are there any fields that matter but haven't been standardized and institutionalized?

The best projects are likely to be overlooked, not trumpeted by a crowd; the best problems to work on are often the ones nobody else even tries to solve.

Rigorous creativity to reach the silent needs.

Business book publishers, for example, must understand booksellers, and corporations that buy books, and the individual readers within those companies.
Hotel managers must understand travel agents, and corporations that have offsite meetings, and the human resources people who organize the corporate offsites, and the people at the company that will be attending the offsite.
Expanding the customer field of vision is critical.

Given three or four potential customers, who is the mose important?
On whom should a business design be most sharply focused?

A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem.

Keep asking yourself these two questions:
How can I create and deliver more value?
How can I increase my capacity for value creation?

Learning how to focus on my customers' tastes rather than my own was an important, early business lesson that has served me well. Any successful businessperson knows you have to do whatever it takes to get objective market research. Just spouting off about what you think the market wants or needs isn't good enough.

Find the answers to these six critical questions:
1. Who are my competitors? Identify both the major players and the smaller players.
2. How does my idea compare and contrast with other products in the market?
3. What value does it offer that the other products do not?
4. How large is the market?
5. Who are my primary customers?
6. What are my potential sales?

Most people innovate backward. They develop a product to solve a problem that bothers them personally without first confirming that it bothers the market universally.

Instead of creating a new market for your idea, create an idea for an existing market.

It's one thing to create a product you like. It's quite another to design a product that consumers like and will buy.

Update or spruce up something that has been around, relatively unchanged, for a long time.

Five simple strategies to product-scouting success:
1. Become a licensing expert.
2. Find your niche.
3. Study the market.
4. Focus on ideas you can sell.
5. Cut a win-win agreement.

It's not about how big or small, how complex or simple, or how unique or clever your idea is. It's about which idea is going to take the least amount of work and has the highest probability of success.

Whenever I come up with an idea I'm interested in, I give it this four-step litmus test to see if it's a potential winner worth pursuing further:
1. Does it solve a common problem?
2. Does it have a wow factor?
3. Does it have a large market?
4. Does it use common production methods and materials?

Companies don't want to educate the market about a product or create a new market for a product. They're like me: they like ideas that are simple to explain and easy to show its unique value. They want ideas that consumers will take one look at and say, "I get it. I love it! I see how it benefits me. I want it."

Whatever you do in life, find someone who has already done it, get as close as you can, and learn as much as you can.

Sometimes, because you're not an expert in a field, you can look at things differently and see simple ideas with mega marketing potential that the "experts" might overlook. But once you get an idea that fires you up, you need to gain some expertise in that field so you can make good decisions about whether and how to move forward with it.

If people are listening to or watching or buying something and you don't get it, inquire as to why. Learn to see through their eyes.
