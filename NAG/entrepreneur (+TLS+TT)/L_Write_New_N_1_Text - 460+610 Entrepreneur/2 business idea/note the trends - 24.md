
Every moment in business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won't create a social network.

Four big lessons from the dot-com crash that still guide business thinking today:
1. Make incremental advances
2. Stay lean and flexible
3. Improve on the competition
4. Focus on product, not sales

Yet the opposite principles are probably more correct:
1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality.
2. A bad plan is better than no plan.
3. Competitive markets destroy profits.
4. Sales matters just as much as product.

How much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes?

Consider the urban hipsterdom: the handlebar mustache, and vinyl record players all hark back to an earlier time when people were still optimistic about the future. If everything worth doing has already been done, you may as well feign an allergy to achievement and become a barista.

What are people not allowed to talk about? What is forbidden or taboo?

Ask: what are people running companies not allowed to say?

Where is the profit?
In yesterday's world, the answer was: with the player who has the highest market share.
In today's world, the answer is: with the player who has the best business model, a model designed for customer relevance and high profitability.
- THIS MAY MOVE AROUND AGAIN SOON
- OR MAYBE IT NEVER MOVES AROUND? HAVE TO THINK ON THIS!

To create a strategic and dynamic perspective on the customer, one must have a clear and compelling point of view on one question:
Exactly how is the customer changing?
Write this question down. It is your single most powerful management weapon.

What if you had to start something? What would it be?
You don't need a good idea to start a business - you can steal one.
Find someone in another town or industry and do what they're doing.
Once you get started, your original idea is going to be replaced anyway.
Smart entrepreneurs don't stick to the original business plan.
You'll realize that every day is another day closer to success, and changing the plan is part of the plan.

The best odds of becoming a billionaire, in summary, exist in industries
that ride the key trends of economic development. This suggests that in
newly industrializing countries, great opportunities may remain in
infrastructure and basic industries. In the world's most developed
economies, however, the cream of tomorrow's billionaires probably will
emerge from communications, services, and technology.

High-growth industries that most often spawn vast personal fortunes tend
to be characterized by fierce struggles for survival. No one islikely to
emerge from such battles without a willingness to push the envelope.

How is it possible for three cowboys to herd a thousand cattle?
Easy. They don't. They herd ten cattle, and those cattle influence fifty
cattle and those cattle influence the rest.
That's the way every single widespread movement/product/service has
changed the world.
Find ten people who care enough about your work to enroll.

Trevor Blackwell presents the following recipe for a startup: "Watch people who have money to spend, see what they're wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them. It's surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution."

Paul Graham, how to make a business work - make something people want

Early adopters: we often talked to them and asked for their feedback. But we emphatically did not do what they said. We viewed their input as only one source of information about our product and overall vision. In fact, we were much more likely to run experiments on our customers than we were to cater to their whims.

Early adopters are suspicious of something that is too polished: if it's ready for everyone to adopt, how much advantage can one get by being early? As a result, additional features or polish beyond what early adopters demand is a form of wasted resources and time.
- THE TREND WILL SHIFT AROUND YOU, AND YOU NEED TO BE READY FOR THAT SHIFT

Early adopters use their imagination to fill in what a product is missing. They prefer that state of affairs, because what they care about above all is being the first

What if there are no businesses to study? Say you've done your homework, canvassed the landscape, and no one is doing what you're proposing. Usually that's bad news, which means you should take a step back. There are millions of smart people in the world. We all have access to the same information and therefore all hatch similar ideas. Most likely, there are reasons that someone has not already capitalized on your idea. Figureout what the roadblocks are before you get started.

Enter an established field. If your business idea is 100 percent original, there is a reason that no one else is doing it. Look around at what other businesspeople are doing. What works for them, and what doesn't? Both mistakes and innovations are best learned by watching others make them first.

if an idea is obvious but nobody else has tried it, there is probably a good reason.

Make sure people want what you're building before you build it.

Take the rifle approach and focus on an industry you're familiar with.

Stay plugged into new and emerging trends.
