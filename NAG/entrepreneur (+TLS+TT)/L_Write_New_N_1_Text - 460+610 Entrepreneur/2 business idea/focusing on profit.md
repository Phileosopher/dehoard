
One of the ugliest moments in business is when the customer changes, the profit model changes, so the business design has to change. It's horrible. You don't want to move mentally because you've been so successful, yet you must move or you'll stagnate or go bankrupt.

Make notes on implications for your organization. Some questions to get you started:
* - Which of these profit models are at work in my business? Can I identify others?
* - How does profit happen in my competitors' businesses?
* - What can I do in the next 90 days to intensify my organization's focus on profitability?
* - Which profit models would enable us to maximize profit this year?
* - Is my organization aligned to capitalize on the profit models in my business?
