Crowdsourcing has the capacity to form a sort of perfect meritocracy. The quality of work takes precedence over pedigree, race, gender, age and qualification.

Crowdsourcing has revealed that, contrary to conventional wisdom, humans do not always behave in predictably self-interested patterns.

People are driven to contribute for a complex web of motivations, including a desire to create something from which the larger community would benefit as well as the sheer joy of practicing a craft at which they excel. People are inspired to contribute to crowdsourcing endeavors for similar motivations, though financial incentives also play a role, especially when the contributors hail from developing countries.

What unites all successful crowdsourcing efforts is a deep commitment to the community.

Two shared attributes among almost all crowdsourcing projects:
- Participants are not primarily motivated by Money
- They are donating their leisure hours to the cause.

In this environment, the "professional" has never been more widely distrusted and the "amateur" more cheerfully embraced.

Crowdsourcing has no more regard for professional qualifications than it has for nationality. Companies like InnoCentive and iStock are meritocracies; all that matters is the final product. This is one of its greatest strengths.

The untrained eye is also untainted. Their (InnoCentive's) greatest asset is a fresh pair of eyes, which is simply a restatement of the truism that with many eyes, all flaws become evident, and easily corrected.

What makes the online community a more efficient workforce than one managed by a firm? The short answer is that communities are better at both identifying talented people and evaluating their output.

The types of crowdsourcing that traffic in collective intelligence take three primary forms.
- The first category is the prediction market, or the information market, in which investors purchase "futures" pegged to some expected outcome, such as the winner of the Oscar for Best Picture, or the Presidential election.
- The second form is the problem solving, or crowdcasting, network, in which someone with a problem broadcasts it to a large, undefined network of potential solvers.
- The third category is the "idea jam" which is essentially just a massive online brainstorming session that takes place over the course of weeks instead of hours.

Crowdsourcing is rooted in a fundamentally egalitarian principle: every individual possesses some knowledge or talent tat some other individual will find valuable. In the broadest terms, crowdsourcing involves making a connection between the two.

Dell's IdeaStorm employs another crucial element of crowdsourcing - the crowd's collective opinion.

Microsoft, Eli Lilly, Goldman Sachs, and Deustche Bank have all used prediction markets to help determine corporate strategy.

The reason diversity trumps ability in a problem - solving scenario is because you can always throw the idiots off the bus.

Before the rise of mass reproduction - there was far less of a distinction between audience and creator. New musical compositions were distributed as sheet music, which could then be interpreted according to regional preference and individual whim. Entertainment was a private affair composed of people entertaining one another. There were very few cultural products that we would describe as "hits" by today's standards. This changed quickly and dramatically with the rise of modern technologies. The mass production and distribution of culture required a more passive form of consumption.

Crowdsourcing depends on the exceptions - Hand a camera to one hundred people and you'll get 99 blurry snapshots and one indelible or salable image. The essence of crowdsourcing such creative work lies in culling the brilliant from the banal.

Crowdsourcing creative work involves cultivating a robust community composed of people with a deep and ongoing commitment to their craft and to one another.

Crowdsourcing the stuff people make - as opposed to the stuff they already know - threatens to disrupt and ultimately displace established companies.

iStocker (Stock photography portal) - developed a credit system - a user could download one image for every image of theirs that had been downloaded by someone else.

People react with great hostility to the idea that crowdsourcing equals cost savings. No one wants to feel exploited.

If you are inviting the crowd to the party, you might as well ask them to help with the planning and cleanup. The crowd likes to be involved.

It is not so much about giving the crowd easier tasks, as it is about building a strategy around the fact that different people are good at different things, have different amounts of time to commit, or simply have different interests.

We had far more guests than anticipated and we didn't have anyone to greet them when they showed up. It was a fateful mistake. (Context - AssignmentZero, a collaboration between Wired and NewAssignment.net started a community portal but launched without having someone upfront who would manage the community.)

Don't try to control the discussion, just provide the room in which it takes place.

AssignmentZero's community of journalists ensured that the interviewer was well informed, asked challenging questions, and managed to elicit interesting commentary.

Most participants will have very little to contribute - tasks have to be constructed to accommodate a range of commitment levels.

American Idol heralded the dawn of a new era. Voting was no longer something you did every couple of years; it was something you did every few days over your cellphone. Voting became part of the culture. Today, people have the opportunity to vote for everything.

The contributions generated by the crowd are far too numerous for anyone but the crowd itself to filter.

Only the collective attention of the crowd, and its enthusiastic embrace of the five-star system, has the manpower - to create an effective filter.

Collective decisions made by millions of Internet users is being used to create a comprehensive classification system where users vote on which news stories of the day deserve attention. (Context - Digg.com)

Threadless (T-shirt makers) - All products sold by Threadless are inspected and approved by user consensus before any larger investment is made into a new product. Users also have the ability to check the 'I'd buy it!' box next to the scale.- a strategy called "collective customer commitment". The dual benefits of giving your customers a vote is you have their commitment and the company knows how much demand exists for every shirt it produces. Small wonder then that every shirt sells out.

Crowdfunding - Directly connecting the people who have money to the people who need it.

Who better to decide what should be created than the person who will ultimately consume the product?

Ten Rules of Crowdsourcing
- Pick the Right Model (successful crowdsourcing projects use a combination of these approaches)
- Collective intelligence or crowd wisdom
- Crowd Creation
- Crowd Voting
- Crowd Funding
- Pick the Right Crowd
- Offer the right incentives
Attracting a crowd is much easier than keeping them. The most important component to a successful crowdsourcing effort is a vibrant, committed community and understanding what motivates people to contribute in the first place. People ned to feel rewarded for their efforts.
- Keep the pink slips in the drawer.
An editor's role will be to lead a conversation, not to deliver a monologue.
- The dumbness of crowds, or the Benevolent Dictator Principle
People might be enthusiastic and capable of some level of self organization but they also require directions and guidance and someone to answer their questions. Most successful crowdsourcing efforts are products of a robust collaboration between the crowd and the individuals guiding them. These people focussed the collective and corrected for some of the common hive mind failure modes.
- Keep it simple and break it down
Modules that can be independently produced before they are assembled into a whole.
- Remember Sturgeon's Law
- Real talent will remain a rare commodity.
- Remember the 10%, the Antidote to Sturgeon's law.
If you find yourself inundated with submissions, don't bother sifting through them yourself. Allowing the crowd to find the best and brightest diamonds in the rough.
- The community is always right
Communities need a decider (as well as a helping hand, a shoulder to cry on, and occasional dean of discipline. You can try to guide the community, but ultimately, wind up following them.
- Ask not what the crowd can do for you, but what you can do for the crowd.
Crowdsourcing works best when an individual or company gives the crowd something it wants. People are drawn to participate because some psychological, social or emotional need is being met. And the need isn't met, they don't participate.
