Multiple sellers communicating with multiple buyers via a power broker associated with the service provider. The more buyers and sellers that join the switchboard, the larger the margin commanded by the service provider.
Ovitz put most of entire movie needs together: representing writer, actors, director.
Can't do it with a small niche: once you have 15-20% of market, an upward spiral kicks in. Perceived probabilities go way up, and all deals start flowing your direction.
More profitable because agent's cut of so many players in one deal. Also, by representing a team rather than individual, far better bargaining power. Probability of striking a deal goes way way up. Studio has to deal with you.
Profitability per unit of effort and unit of time is probably 7-10 times greater than in the traditional model.
Examples: EBAY, Wilson & Sonsini (Silicon Valley startups), Michael Ovits (Hollywood deals)

############# SWITCHBOARD PROFIT

Multiple sellers communicating to multiple buyers.
High transaction costs are incurred by both.
Often, there is an opportunity to create a high-value intermediary that concentrates these multiple communication pathways through one point, or one channel, by creating a "switchboard."
The switchboard reduces the costs (both financial expenditures and personal aggravation) of both buyers and sellers, in exchange for a fee to the switchboard operator.
Examples include Schwab's OneSource, Softbank's combination of trade publications and trade shows, and Auto-by-Tel.
It builds on itself.
