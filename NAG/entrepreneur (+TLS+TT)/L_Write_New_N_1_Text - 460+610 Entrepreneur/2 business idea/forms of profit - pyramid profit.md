Company caters to different levels of price sensitivity. Offer a range of services from low price / high volume to higher price and lower volume.
The base of the pyramid consists of low-priced high-volume products, while the apex is made up of high-priced low-volume products. The bulk of profitability is concentrated at the top of the product pyramid, but the base plays a strategic role -- often through a "firewall" brand -- in protecting the profitability at the top.
At Mattel: Barbie = $20-$30. But imitators can come in below you, so you build a firewall, a $10 Barbie. Barely profitable but prevents other companies from establishing a connection with your customers. And even girls who start with the $10 Barbie move on to buy accessories. Then made a $100-$200 Barbie for nostalgic collectors.
Can't build a pyramid without understanding all of the customers: current and potential.
Has to be more than just a collection of products at different price points.
A true pyramid is a system in which the lower-priced products are manufactured and sold with so much efficiency that it's virtually impossible for a competitor to steal market share by underpricing you. A firewall.
Premium gas = bad pyramid because there's no reason to buy the top one. American Express Platinum card = so-so pyramid for same reason.
Can only be applied in a few situations: 1 out of 50.
The customers themselves form a heirarchy, with different expectations and attitudes towards price. The pyramid is made to capture them all.
Other examples: Nokia phones, Swatch, GM cars. Think of 10 more?

############# PRODUCT PYRAMID PROFIT

Customer preferences of style, color, price, and so on, are of utmost importance.
The variations in customer income and preferences make it possible to build product pyramids.
They exist in markets as diverse as watchmaking, automotive sales, and credit cards.

The profit is concentrated at the top of the product pyramid.

Build a "firewall" brand at the bottom of the pyramid: a strong, low-priced brand that is produced at a profit, however slim.
The purpose of this brand is to deter competitor entry, thereby protecting the enormous profit margins at the top of the pyramid.

When a firewall brand isn't built, competitors have the opportunity to come in at the bottom and then work their way toward the top, where the profits are.
Witness the history of the U.S. automotive market from 1965 to 1995. Japanese competitors first occupied the base with cars designed to be profitable, even at low price levels. They then moved up (Honda's Acura, Toyota's Lexus, Nissan's Infiniti) to where the higher profits were.
