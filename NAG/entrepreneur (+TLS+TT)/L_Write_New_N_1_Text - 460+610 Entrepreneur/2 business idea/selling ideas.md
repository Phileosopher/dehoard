The only opinions that really matter are the opinions of potential licensees.

Companies are only interested in licensing ideas they can:
• Put on their existing production lines quickly and easily, with little or no modification to their manufacturing processes
• Distribute through existing channels in which they already operate or that are closely related to the channels in which they operate
• Produce at a cost and sell at a price that is profitable

Call the manufacturer and ask for someone in sales. I would say something like, "I'm Stephen Key with Stephen Key Design. I'm working on a special project for a client, and I'd like to send over some drawings and get a price quote." The sales rep is going to fall all over him- or herself trying to help you and supply you with what you need. Just make sure to send over a nondisclosure agreement (NDA), and make sure you've already filed a provisional patent application on your idea.

Send over a drawing, and I make sure to include "Patent Pending" on the drawing so they know some intellectual property protection has been filed.

Ask for a price quote on 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 units. The sales rep will go to work for you and come back with a price quote and all this other information to help you because the sales rep wants to get an order! It's brilliant.

Occasionally, I will call contract manufacturers and ask to speak to engineers. If I ask a few basic manufacturing questions and don't ask them to divulge any trade secrets, they're usually very helpful. Sometimes, you can't get them to shut up, because they're so happy to have someone interested in what they're doing.

If the sales rep or the engineer tells you that the company can't manufacture your idea, ask him or her why. This way you can understand the manufacturing process, then redesign if necessary.

To successfully bring an idea to market, you must control every step of the process - from developing your idea to protecting and licensing it. Throughout the process, you must also control who knows about your idea, what they know about it, how you tell them about it, and when. So protect your idea with a PPA and an NDA before showing it to anybody.
