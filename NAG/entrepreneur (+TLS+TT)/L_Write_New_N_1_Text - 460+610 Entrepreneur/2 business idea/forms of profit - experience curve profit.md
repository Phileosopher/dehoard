Experience in serving the market and strong financial management drives down the transactional cost. (Basically just continuing to optimize?)
Danger is focusing on this too much and losing peripheral vision. (Focus + Peripheral Vision = 100%. The less you have of one, the more you have of the other.) Microscope versus radar screen. Can't be looking at both at the same time.
At the edge of the radar screen is where new things come to make you irrelevant, or the invention of a new model that delivers the same thing at a 20-30% lower cost, like Southwest Airlines, Dell Computer, Nucor steel, Wal-Mart, Geico, Home Depot. Incumbents are busy managing costs, and someone comes along to introduce the next system. See next point...
