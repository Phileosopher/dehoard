The market pushes creators to give away their work.
Too often, we come to believe that giving it away, removing money from
the interaction, is the most generous thing we can do.
But that's not the case.
Money supports our commitment to the practice.
Money permits us to turn professional, to focus our energy and our time
on the work, creating more impact and more connection, not less.
Money is how our society signifies enrollment.
The person who has paid for your scarce time and scarce output is more
likely to value it, to share it, and to take it seriously.

A startup should give its competitors as little information as possible.

If you give more value than you receive while ensuring you're being
treated fairly, and not falling into a pattern of self-sacrifice, the
excess value you provide will overflow into public goodwill.
