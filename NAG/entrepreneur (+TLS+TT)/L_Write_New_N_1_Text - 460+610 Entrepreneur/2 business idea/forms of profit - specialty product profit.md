Similar to brand profit but companies use above standard materials and design to generate higher margins until competitors start to imitate.
The dyestuff business had been a specialty product business like big pharma. Lots of little unique patented products with huge margins. 10 years ago, 80% of profits came from those. Now 80% of profits are from commodity stuff. The profit model shifted from specialty product to cost-and-cycle management.
Key is to develop new niche products.
Difference from Blockbuster is that this is niche: specialty foods, specialty papers, etc. Finding a legitimate need or variation and addressing it.
Examples: Apple (computers), Ben and Jerry's (ice cream), Prada (shoes), Tumi (bags)
