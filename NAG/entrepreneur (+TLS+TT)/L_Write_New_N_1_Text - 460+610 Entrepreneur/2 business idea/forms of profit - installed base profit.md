Initial product sales or profits are slim and profit is realized on follow-up products and services.
Two buckets:
(1) hardware. 2-5% profit. new demand. bigger price sensitivity. customer has power.
(2) consumables. 10-15% profit. continuing demand. less price sensitivity. seller has power.
Seller can fuck up by making price too high so customer switches brands.
Or if sellers doesn't work to make it easy for customer to buy: early notice, reminders, multiple units per follow-up sale, turning passive receipt into stimulating usage and growth.
Take some aspect of your business where customers are returning naturally and stimulate it more - market aggressively.
Let customers guide you : they're the ones who decide what they're willing to pay for, and how much.
Examples: All suppliers of laser printers and video game players. Sony (Playstation), Hewlett Packard (printers, cameras), Canon (printers, cameras), Gillette (razors)
