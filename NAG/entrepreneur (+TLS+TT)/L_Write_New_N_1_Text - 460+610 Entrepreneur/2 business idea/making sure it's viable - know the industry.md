Sara had never done anything in fashion before. So she spent every day
at the library and the hosiery stores. She had a full-time job but at
night she researched every patent. She bought every type of panty hose.
She knew the entire industry. To succeed at something: Know every
product in the industry Know every patent Try out all the products
Understand how the products are made Make a product that YOU would use
every single day. You can't sell it if you personally don't LOVE it

When I was building a trading business, I must've read more than two
hundred books on trading and talked to another two hundred traders.

I felt like I knew more about trading and the top investors out there
than anyone else in the world.

When I was building websites, I knew everything about programming for
the web. There was nothing I couldn't do. And the competition, usually
run by businessmen and not programmers, knew that about me.
