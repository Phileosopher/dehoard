when struggling for idea topics, search Twitter for phrases like:

Companies that use Groupons are struggling for customers and need
creative ideas. Come up with other ways to promote the company or make
their product better.

We love to point out how broken things are, but we rarely look at merely
mediocre products and wonder why they aren't great. Why is this mediocre?

Being a musician and making a living as one are two different things. If you want to earn a living, you must get paid by someone who values your services. The question entertainers need to ask themselves is not, Are we talented? but, Do we have drawing power?

It is often much faster and more economical for a company to bring to market a licensed product based on a simple idea - an improvement or enhancement to an existing product - than it is to start at square one in R&D and go through the whole long, complicated, and expensive process of coming up with and developing an idea themselves. So licensing our ideas is really just good business for companies. It reduces their R&D costs. It accelerates their product development time. And it creates a multiplying effect: essentially getting other people to develop ideas for them for free.

A simple improvement or a small incremental change to an existing product is often the easiest, fastest, most cost-effective, and most profitable way for companies to bring a new product to market.

Very few, if any, companies and investors go searching the Internet and "tweeting" for ideas to license or fund. Nor do they routinely (if ever) scout social media or any other media for ideas to bring to market. Nor do they frequent (if they visit at all) inventor and product developer forums in search of the next big idea, which in reality is usually a simple idea with big market potential. These services and media channels may serve a good purpose, but it is not to bring a licensee to your door, despite innumerable claims to the contrary.

It is far more effective to go out there and find a licensee for your idea. Doing your homework to identify and qualify potential licensees
