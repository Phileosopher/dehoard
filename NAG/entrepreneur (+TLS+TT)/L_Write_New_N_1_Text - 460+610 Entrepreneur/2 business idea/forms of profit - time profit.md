Takes advantage of innovation, newness, uniqueness, to gain time limited competitive advantage. Requires strong early sales effort to maximize high margin revenue. Profit margins quickly erode as competition catches-up.
When a product is new, it earns premium profits. Then, when a competitor copies the innovation, price competition drives profits to zero. Companies relying on this model make continuous innovation the modus operandi.
Invent. Then make a ton of money before the imitation starts.
Needs instant diffusion: a faster way to squeeze out the juice before everyone else learns the secret. Systemize: 2 weeks before announcing a new product, email 200 clients letting them know it's on the way, a week in advance call them to tell them again, a few days before launch train all employees covering every detail of it until everyone is ready to cover every detail of it in their sleep. Launch Monday and sign up a ton of people immediately.
What separates winners and losers in innovation is who masters the drudgery. The creative process usually starts with a brilliant idea. Next you determine whether, if the brilliant idea worked, it would be worth doing from a business standpoint. That's exhilarating and most stimulating part, but it's also the easiest. Then comes the real work: reducing the idea to practice. That's the drudgery part, and the part where people need the most pressure and encouragement. People go into pits as they try to turn that idea into products that can be manufactured.
Examples: Intel (CPUs), Apple (iPod)
