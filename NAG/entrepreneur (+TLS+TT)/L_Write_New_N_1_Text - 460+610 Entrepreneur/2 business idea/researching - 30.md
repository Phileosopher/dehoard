
For new ideas, the spirit is willing, but the implementation is weak

the more research, the more prepared
- at the same time, you'll NEVER get it fully researched out right

rule of thumb: do the most risky thing in the safest possible way

The uniquely qualified minds to make new discoveries were outside the boundaries of his organization.

Harness the new collaboration or perish. Those who fail to grasp this will find themselves ever more isolated: cut off from networks sharing, adapting, and updating knowledge to create value.

How most businesses operate: When releasing a new product, a company
will spend months, sometimes years, fine-tuning, building up to one
critical moment: the launch. Then on launch day the product either is a
success or a failure. People buy it and the company makes a profit, or
they don't and the product fails.

Upworthy sent the same video with a handful of different headlines to
different subscribers. Upworthy wrote alternate versions of the winning
headline and sent it out to several other groups. It repeated the
process a ruthless 18 times, for a total of 75 variations in all.

DHH: "If I can put in 5 percent of the effort of somebody getting an A,
and I can get a C minus, that's amazing. It's certainly good enough,
right? [Then] I can take the other 95 percent of the time and invest it
in something I really care about."

An entrepreneur learns two things from failure: First he learns directly
how to overcome that particular failure. He's highly motivated to not
repeat the same mistakes. Second, he learns how to deal with the
psychology of failure.
- THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO FAIL FAST

(from God's Gold) Rockefeller's life was utterly free of accident because he calculated EVERYTHING pristinely
- In a way, the best way to be prepared is to steadily and obsessively overthink ALL possible things, then make the wisest decision after researching the heck out of something
- Also, acting slower in a season of endless churn is crucial: save money, prepare for an undeterrable strike at what you want

The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build - the thing customers want and will pay for - as quickly as possible.

The point is not to find the average customer but to find early adopters: the customers who feel the need for the product most acutely. Those customers tend to be more forgiving of mistakes and are especially eager to give feedback.

This specification will be rooted in feedback on what is working today rather than in anticipation of what might work tomorrow.

To study successful businesses you have to visit their stores, factories, offices - try their products, test their services, spend time at their websites. Most important you've got to talk with their customers, live with them, get to know their needs, wants, problems by spending time with them, seeing what they do, what works for them & what doesn't. What annoys them & what makes their lives easy or productive or fun. You'll learn more from 1 hour with a customer then 50 research studies.

No book, blog or conference could ever teach you more about your customers than you learn from watching them use your software.

I just went to Toys "R" Us and walked the aisles. I looked at what was on the shelves and tried to imagine ways to make a small change that would have a big impact.

My shopping excursions only planted the seed of an idea. I had to do more market research to germinate that idea: to figure out how to design it, how much it should cost, who might license it, and so on.

Discover hot markets and emerging trends. Check out websites such as Trendsetter.com and MindBranch.com

Look at new products, and ask store managers which items are hot.

There are usually three or four big companies that produce most of the products in a given market. Review their product pages or online catalogs. Go to their media page and read any new product releases.

Innovation through observation is observing how people use products at home, at work, or at play to identify their wants, needs, and desires.

Paul came up with ideas by looking at how kids play traditional childhood games and then updating them. One day he decided to take a look at a game kids have been playing forever: tag. "What can we do to update tag?" he asked himself and his team of engineers. "Is there any technology we can apply to tag?" Sure enough, they came up with Lazer Tag, using infrared technology.

I went into the Disney store at my local mall and asked the manager what their most popular product was. He said it was their cups. I saw that some of the plastic cups had a double-layer outer wall. The back layer was a color (red, blue, yellow, etc.), the front layer was clear plastic, and there were sparkles between the two layers. I immediately thought of other images and games you could put between the two layers of plastic, which kids could play by rotating the cup.

I looked on the bottom of the cups in the Disney store and saw the manufacturer's name, Trudeau. They licensed the idea from me, and for five years my rotating character cups were sold in every Disney store and theme park worldwide.

"What if a combination lock had letters, instead of numbers, so you could spell out your secret code?" He now has a successful product, Wordlock, which is sold in tens of thousands of stores around the world.

Many companies don't know how or don't have a system in place to go find those ideas. Likewise, many independent product developers don't know how to license their ideas, and some simply prefer hiring someone to "rep" their ideas to licensees for them. This scenario creates a huge opportunity for you to profit from connecting innovators with manufacturers. As a product scout, you find great ideas and then find the right companies to license them. In return for your services, the product designer splits the licensing royalty with you.

Become a licensing expert: a master at finding marketable ideas and getting them into the marketplace.

At inventRight we offer courses with CDs and workbooks as well as online classes and other tools for learning how to find, develop, and license great ideas.

Another great resource is Ideapow: an "online learning lab" for "entrepreneurial-minded people" who want to learn how to license ideas.

Far too many inventors and independent product developers overlook this step. They design with no knowledge of, and with no regard to, manufacturing.
