
We are going to need miracles. We call these miracles technology.

It allows us to do more with less, find value in unexpected places.

The future will be a time when the world looks different from today.

A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future. A new company's most important strength is new thinking.

What a startup has to do: question received ideas and rethink business from scratch.

If something is "socially good," is it good for society, or merely seen as good by society? Whatever is good enough to receive applause from all audiences can only be conventional.

Doing something different is what's truly good for society.
