The company thrives on reducing the cost per unit through cumulative experience.
You might need two organizations: the experience-curve incumbent and the blank-sheet-of-paper gang. Maximizing your current hand while simultaneously buying a big insurance policy on the future.
The low-cost business design doesn't need huge market share to be hugely profitable. It is hugely profitable as long as it continues to be dramatically lower-cost.
Value Migration (book): how you have to change your business design every 5 years. (Though it takes 2-3 years to change!) So you need to see it coming, start preparing for it. Give yourself a 2-year runway to get the new business design off the ground. Start sooner. Move faster. Anticipate.

############# LOW COST BY DESIGN

You can trump cumulative experience with a low-cost business design, which makes the incumbent's cumulative experience irrelevant.
Nucor did this in steel (the minimill model trumped the integrated mill)
Southwest Air, in air travel (the point-to-point model trumped hub-and-spoke)
Dell, in computing (direct marketing trumped a feet-on-the-street sales force and multilevel distribution channels).
The player focused on building cumulative experience to gain lowest cost is always vulnerable to the player who creates a low-cost position through design.
