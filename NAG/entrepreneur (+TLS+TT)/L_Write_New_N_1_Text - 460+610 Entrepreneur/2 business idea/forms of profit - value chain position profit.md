"He who occupies the mountain pass can easily battle a thousand." What's true in geography is true in business. There are places in the value chain that are 10 times more valuable than others in terms of profit, power, control. When earthquakes or floods happen, the location of these special places changes, making some vulnerable and others blessed.
Intel and Microsoft as suppliers to the industry.
Would you rather be Wal-Mart or a supplier to Wal-Mart? (Wal-Mart)
Would you rather be Tom Clancy or his publisher? (Tom Clancy)
Note pre-existing control points. (There are none: they're conditional depending on the circumstances: relative value added, trajectory. MS + Intel vs PC makers. Wal-Mart vs suppliers. Creation of scarcity. Capturing bottleneck. Connection to the customer: a better connection than the other value-chain players have. Profit from predictability. The company that owns the control point sets the pace. Its business plan defines the future. The others react, always a step behind.)
Note radical shifts in control points. 3 shifts from integrated system to specialists who control the action: computing, athletic shoes, Hollywood.
Note new control points that will arise in the next 2 years.
Partner with other members of the value chain (suppliers) to provide a more complete customer oriented service.
Example: Cingular (partners with Motorola, Sony, insurer to sell Walkman mobile phone)
