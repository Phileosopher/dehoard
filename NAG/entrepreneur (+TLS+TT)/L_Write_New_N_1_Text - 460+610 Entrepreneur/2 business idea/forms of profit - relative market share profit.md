Companies with high market share tend to be more profitable. Large companies have price advantages due to manufacturing experiences and volume economies from better supplier relationships.
Invest to win. Build a bigger lead. If you try and fail, cut your losses or get out completely. (Jack Welch was its most thoughtful practitioner.)
Economics of scale. Purchasing advantage. Marketing & advertising. Because lowest overhead per-unit, spread costs over greater volumes than any other competitor. Attract the best talent in the industry. Biggest cash flow, so can outspend rivals. Leader has least volatility, lowest risk. Controlled initiative while others react.
Used to think profit was just Relative Market Share, but it's function of many things: time, location, offering, local Relative Market Share.
