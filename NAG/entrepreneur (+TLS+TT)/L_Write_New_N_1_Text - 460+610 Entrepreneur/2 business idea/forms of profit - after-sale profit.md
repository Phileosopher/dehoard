Price sensitivity changes for different purchase occasions. Low sensitivity on coffee is what made Starbucks ($2-$3 for a 10-cent cup). For a TV it's high: people price-shop relentlessly. Airfare and cars: the highest.
But people will pay top dollar for a car in big demand.
Price sensitivity is lowest when ticket price is low and there are few options.
The action starts with the high-visibility big-ticket sale. Computers, cars, equipment. Buyers go to the wall to get the lowest price. Their zeal drives the profit out.
But the initial transaction creates a new situation: a need for follow-up stuff that did not exist before. You didn't need the service contract before you bought the elevator, PC, pickup truck. Didn't need the replacement parts or accessories. A whole new minimarket created by the initial sale. Ticket prices are tiny. Frequency of purchase is greater.
Similarities to Installed Base model, except in this one, lots of different companies can benefit.
Big-ticket companies should customize the after-sale stuff to the original sale product, so the customer has a compelling reason to buy the after-sale items and services from them.
Work hard to turn the after-sale profit model into the installed base profit model.
But selling this after-sale stuff is so unglamorous that many less are shooting for it : you can quietly sell service contracts and insurance for a lot of profit. Needs a very different organization focused only on that.
Company sells financing and services to support equipment and goods originally purchased from other suppliers.
Example: General Electric (nuclear power plant services, auto loans, insurance)
