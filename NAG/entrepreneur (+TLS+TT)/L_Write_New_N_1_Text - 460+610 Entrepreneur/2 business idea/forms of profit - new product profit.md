Profit explosion happens at the beginning, during the gold-rush days. Margins are fat and volume is skyrocketing. Multiply these two and you get a growing ocean of profitability.
The Profit Parabola |_/\_ "The total profit earned by all players in a market goes up, peaks, and comes back down to zero."

Starts with Gold Rush, goes to Pike's Peak, then No Profit Zone.
Problem is: during the Gold Rush, swept into the psychology, into the zone where even weak producers make money because demand is so strong. You can't think clearly about how to manage strategically.
Step #1: admit this is all true. (It's like a 22-year-old admitting he'll get old and impotent.)
Step #2: manage Parabola strategically: Overinvest by a factor of 3 on the left-hand side, and underinvest by a factor of 3 on the right-hand side. On the left-hand side fight for mindshare, be seen as the leader. Be everywhere.
Start measuring things that will give you clues you're at Pike's Peak. Growth rates. Customer excitement or boredom.
Then reverse the investment ratio a year before hitting the peak. Not getting out of the market, just managing the business to maximize cash flow and minimize the risk profile on the other side. Start building flexible plants instead of dedicated ones. Look for opportunities to sell dedicated plants to inevitable latecomers who still wanted to get into the game.
Be in a great position when things start getting ugly. Pull back on advertising, since everyone knows you from early mindshare grab. Serve the good customers & drop some bad ones.
Then be looking for the next wave. Spend a tremendous amount of time scouting the lanscape, looking for early signals of the inflection.
Time Profit: 2-year cycle, speed, race car, "when you see #2 in the rear-view mirror, step on the gas". Chips, electronics.
New Profit Product: 4-year cycle, shift resources, surfing, "get off the last wave first, get on the new wave first". Cars, copiers.
Specialty Product Profit: 10-year cycle, select, seismography, "find the richest fields: the place where customer need, technical feasibility, and lack of competition intersect"
