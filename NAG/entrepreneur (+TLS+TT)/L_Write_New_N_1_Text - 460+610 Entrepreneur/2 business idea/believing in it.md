Ask, "Would anyone cry if I went out of business?" If the answer is no,
you're on the wrong path.

When you attempt to satisfy your personal values without providing any
real social value, you get the starving-artist syndrome : you may be
inspired by work you love doing, but it won't pay the bills.

The solution is to work within the area of overlap between your personal
values and social values. This will enable you to do what you love while
creating something that others treasure as well. Don't force yourself to
choose between your integrity and your income - demand that both be
satisfied.

Often the simplest way to create value for others is by sharing what you
love to do.
