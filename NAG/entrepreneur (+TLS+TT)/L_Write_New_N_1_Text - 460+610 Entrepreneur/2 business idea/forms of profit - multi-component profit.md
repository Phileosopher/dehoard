Same product, several businesses.
Offer a range of services that includes higher margin specialty items and loss leading, high demand services. Caters to customers that consolidate on fewer suppliers.
Multiple products and/or sales channels, and only some of these represent the bulk of profitability. To maximize sales in the high-profitability components, it's necessary to have full presence in the less-profitable components as well.
Different parts of a business can have wildly different profitability.
The customer behaves very differently on different purchase occasions. Different degrees of price sensitivity.
Coke per ounce: .02 in grocery store, .06 in vending machine, .12 in restaurant
Hotel: single room for 1 night, one-day meeting for 20 people, three-day convention for 3000 people.
Bookstore: foot-traffic component, ecommerce component, book-club component, corporate-purchasing component.
Story of guy who saw bookstore could be a base for building several new high-profit components: corporate business, book-group business, personal service business. Dramatically intensify outbound selling activities. Have a couple account managers call on corporate libraries and HR depts to promote latest business books. Services to local book groups. Promoting sales to high-purchase individuals. (Their best customers bought $500/year, but never realized these people represented a separate component of their business that they could consciously deliberately target and grow.)
With little increase in labor (+ 2 account managers) and no increase in assets, bookstores that were barely surviving turned into obscsenely profitable businesses.
Developed 200 company accounts (corps, law firms, accountants), 200 book groups, 500 high-purchase individuals. Increased not just sales but customer satisfaction, flow of info as to what customers wanted.

############# MULTICOMPONENT SYSTEM PROFIT

Failure to maximize participation in the highest-profit components depresses the profitability of the entire system. On the other hand, full participation in the less profitable components is required to win the market for the most profitable components.

Grocery, 2 cents per ounce; fountain, 4 cents per ounce; vending, 6 cents

In coffee, the components are grocery, cafés, and kiosks.
Grocery is low margin, cafés are high margin, and kiosks are even higher still
Procter & Gamble, Nestlé, and General Foods play against each other in grocery and break even.
Starbuck's plays in cafés and kiosks and enjoys extraordinary returns.

Multicomponent profit models apply to industries as diverse as
beverages (the profit is in fountain and vending)
hotels (the base business has low margins, the corporate meeting business is highly profitable)
bookstores (the bookstore itself is asset-intensive, low margin; the institutional business from corporations, book clubs, and other sources is high profit, low asset intensity).
