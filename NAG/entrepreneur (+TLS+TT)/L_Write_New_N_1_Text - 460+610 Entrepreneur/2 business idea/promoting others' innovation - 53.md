Customer tool kits and context orchestration: Forget about static, immovable products. If your customers are going to treat products as platforms anyway, then you may as well get ahead of the game. Make your products modular, reconfigurable, and editable. Set the context for customer innovation and collaboration. Provide venues. Build user-friendly customer tool kits. Supply the raw materials that customers need to add value to your product. Make it easy to remix and share.

Your real business is not creating finished products but innovating ecosystems.

Customers will expect to share in the ownership and fruits of their creations. If you make it profitable for customers to get involved, you will always be able to count on a dynamic and fertile ecosystem for growth and innovation.

Customers won't care whether their activities make you more money (that's your job) - they'll just want a superior product and experience, and perhaps even a cut of the revenue.

The best examples are the developer communities that have built up around eBay, Google, Amazon. External partners can build tools to leverage the database information, invent new kinds of stores or applications, and generally integrate their business processes. 40% of goods on eBay are now uploaded automatically from the inventory systems of 3rd-party stores that use eBay as an alternative sales channel.

Open up your platforms to increase the speed, scope, and success of innovation.

How do I make my organization a platform for participation?

How, when, and where do I open up my business?

How do I attract an energetic group of people to share the innovation load?

Om Malik blog post : "I wonder if this culture of participation was helping build businesses on our collective backs. If we tag, bookmark, or share and help del.icio.us or Technorati or Yahoo become better commerical entities, aren't we commoditizing our most valuable asset: time? We become the outsourced workforce, though it is still unclear what is the payoff. While we may gain something from the collective efforts, the odds are whatever the collective efforts are, they are going to boost the economic value of those entities. Will we share in the upside? Not likely!"

Most of the free electrons will gravitate towards the biggest centers of gravity. Companies with the most dynamic platforms - with great opportunities for partners to establish a synergistic business - will have the best chance of harnessing the enormous wealth of talent that all those free agents can offer.

The bigger the ecosystem, the better, because bigger ecosystems support more raw intelligence and more requisite variety. Becoming a pervasive and continually innovative presence means becoming a magnet for innovation that attracts lots of partners, suppliers, developers, customers, and other interested participants who are willing to build on your organization's platform.

We are shifting from closed and hierarchical workplaces with rigid employment relationships to increasingly self-organized, distributed, and collaborative human capital networks that draw knowledge and resources from inside and outside the firm.

Goldcorp story : couldn't find any more gold in their mines, though geologists said it was there somewhere, so as a last-ditch effort they put up all data since 1948 free online, and launched the "Goldcorp Challenge", paying $500k in prizes to participants with the best methods and estimates.

"You simply don't give away proprietary data. It's so fundamental that no one had ever challenged it."

If a small underperforming company in one of the world's oldest industries (Goldcorp) can achieve greatness by opening its doors to external input and innovation, what would happen if more organizations followed the same strategy?

Marketocracy: 70,000 traders to manage virtual stock portfolios in a competition to become the best investors. Marketocracy indexes the top 100 performers, and their trading strategies are emulated in a mutual fund that consistently outperforms the S&P 500.

Winning organizations will be those that tap the torrent of human knowledge and translate it into new and useful applications.

This utterly decentralized and amorphous force increasingly self-organizes to provide its own news, entertainment, and services.

Losers innovated internally. Winners innovated with their users. Losers jealously guarded their data and software interfaces. Winners shared them with everyone.

Couldn't just about any social or economic challenge be solved with a critical mass of self-organized contributors seeking an answer to the problem?

Wouldn't businesses be more productive if they could reach outside their walls to harness the insights and energies of a vast network of peers that converge around shared interests and goals?

If so, how would the traditional corporation change? What new business models could be built on this new collaborative approach to producing goods and services?

Jim Griffin on music biz : "Tarzan economics : we cling to the vine that holds us off the jungle floor, and we can't let go of the one we've got until we've got the next vine firmly in our hand."

Firms threatened by self-organizing prosumer communities face the innovator's dilemma.

The innovator taps a low-cost or no-cost volunteer production resource.

Move early to participate in building a brand-new business. By joining the community of new innovators, you might even position yourself at the front of the parade.

A new kind of business is emerging: one that
- opens its doors to the world
- co-innovates with everyone, especially customers
- shares resources that were previously closely guarded
- harnesses the power of mass collaboration
- behaves not as a multinational, but as a truly global firm

Make a comprehensive map of your innovation eco system that positions your value creation and aasses the interdependencies that will determine the flow of benefits and your ability to capture a share of them. This is not a traditional competitive analysis or value-chain analysis, but an analysis of the participants creating knowledge pertinent to your existing and future business. While this includes business partners and competitors, it extends to academia, public research institutes, think tanks, creative communities, or communities of practice, and contract research organizations. The map needs to be global and cover all relevant disciplines that intersect with your strategy.

You're taking down your borders and opening up for no tariffs, no tax competition. You need to know that your core assets and your skill sets allow you to continue to innovate fast enough as a corporation.

Openness does up the ante - it drives real value to the fore and forces every company to compete on a level playing field.
- IT ALSO GUARANTEES MORE [INFLUENCE] THAN KEEPING IT TO YOURSELF

Loose, voluntary communities of producers can self-organize to do just about anything:
- design goods or services
- create knowledge
- assemble physical things
- produce dynamic shared experiences
but don't overlook the fact that these communities operate according to well-defined norms, and have internal processes to guide the group's activities.

Debates remain on the public archive.

Sharing is about lowering costs, building community, accelerating discovery.

The growth of increasingly valuable online resources as a natural by-product of their use by self-regarding individuals. (No altrusitic sharing motives need be present, especially since sharing is the default in most online communities, including Flickr, Napster, and YouTube.)

If you ask 100 people to run a 100-meter race, the average time will not be better than the time of the fastest runners. It will be worse - a mediocre time. But ask 100 people to answer a question or solve a problem, and the average number will often be as least as good as the answer of the smartest member. With most things, the average is mediocrity. With decision making, it's often excellence.

(About product innovation or small companies:) What makes a system successful is its ability to generate lots of losers and then to recognize them as such and kill them off. Sometimes the messiest approach is the wisest.

Generating a diverse set of possible solutions isn't enough. The crowd also has to be able to distinguish the good solutions from the bad.

The simple fact of making a group diverse makes it better at problem solving.

Grouping only smart people together doesn't work that well, because the smart people tend to resemble each other in what they can do. The group knows less than it otherwise might. Adding in a few people who know less, but have different skills, actually improves the group's performance.

Encouraging people to make incorrect guesses actually made the group as a whole smarter.

In the 50 years since Vernon Smith did his first experiment in [wisdom of crowds] and published the results, they have been replicated thousands of times in ever more complex variations. But the essential conclusion of those early tests has not been challenged : that, under the right conditions, imperfect humans can produce near-perfect results.

To solve cooperation problems - like keeping the sidewalk free of snow, paying taxes, and curbing pollution - the members of a society need to do more. They need to adopt a broader definition of self-interest than the myopic one that maximizing profits in the short-term demands. And they need to trust those around them, because in the absense of trust the pursuit of myopic self-interest is the only strategy that makes sense.

Hawthorne Heights (Indie Band) - Each musician would spend four to five hours online everyday, engaging their fans in banter and generally making themselves accessible. The fans loved it! The fans couldn't believe they were actually getting a response, they had a fan for life because of that! By frequently updating their blog and swapping in new songs on their MySpace profile, Hawthorne Heights was able to give fans a reason to return.

Paid employees can be told what to do, online communities do what they want - Its often a price well worth paying.

Linda Parker ("Online communities editor", for the Cincinati Post) - "It used to read, 'Be a Citizen Journalist' and no one ever clicked on it, then we said, "Tell us your story" and still nothing. For some reason, 'Get Published' were the magic words."

Von Hippel (Head of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Group at MIT's Sloan School of Management) demonstrated that in fields as wide ranging as scientific instruments and mountain bikes and computer chips, the task of innovation was passing from the manufacturer to the user, who has both a greater need and a greater ability to improve a product's performance. Companies that embraced this change entered into a creative relationship with their customers, even going so far as to provide them with tools to help design the end products.

The ultimate success of one solution is not diminished by the number of unsuccessful solutions. As more people apply more diverse sets of problem solving methods, the odds that someone will crack the nut can't help but go up. And if they're wrong, you can just ignore them. But this truth only applies to crowdcasting projects like the Netflix Prize and InnoCentive. When we're using the crowd to predict the future, every response counts in the final tally. In these cases, the role of diversity is far more complex.

The best ideas result in enhanced status for their authors. Others naturally strive to meet or exceed the standard set by most talented of their peers, a tendency that effectively increases the overall quality of the work produced by the community. Much of the interaction between community members revolves around improving their skills. People like to learn and they like to teach. The community has an unerring ability to identify its most talented members and highlight their work.

Many designers think they can simply list their ideas on a website and it will somehow sell itself. Companies simply do not search these sites for ideas. But you can, and you know how to evaluate an idea. These designers are likely to be desperate for some help licensing their ideas. Try typing these keywords into your browser and then bookmark any sites that you like:
• "Invention for sale" or "inventions for sale"
• "Patent for sale" or "patents for sale"
• "Invention listing sites"

Visit inventor forums. Do an Internet search for "inventors forums" or "inventors discussion groups" to find forums where you can go check out what's on the minds and drawing boards of designers.
