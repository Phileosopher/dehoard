Study customers, create a custom solution set with multiple services. Develop the relationship.

Once Factset identified a company as a potential customer, they'd send a team of 2-3 people to work there for a few months, learning everything they could about the customer, how their systems worked (& didn't work), what they really cared about. Based on this genuine knowledge, they'd develop customized products and services tailored to the specific characteristics and economics of the account. Once they landed the account, they spent a ton of time integrating their product into the customer's systems. During this process, revenues were tiny and costs were huge. But after 3-4 months, they were woven into the daily flow of customer's operations. Software debugged and working fine. Now one person could maintain account, part-time. More people in company use it. Costs fall, revenues grow.
Potential applications: Anything, except where there is no relationship-building.

############# CUSTOMER DEVELOPMENT/ CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS PROFIT

Invest heavily to understand their customers' economics and find ways to make them more favorable.
Reach the profit zone by first probing how their customers buy and use their products and then finding ways - beyond merely selling the products - to help the customers in the difficult, expensive, or time-consuming areas of their process.
Customer selection and front-end-loaded customer investment were the means of creating customer continuity, which was the key driver of profit.
Other successful firms that have applied the discipline of the customer development model include Nordstrom, the United States Auto Association (USAA), Intuit, Northwestern Life, and Leo Burnett, all of which have achieved significantly higher customer continuity than their competitors
