
The secret to success in any new sector is watchfulness, usually over a period of many years.

No sector will ever be so important that merely participating in it will be enough to build a great company.

The scope of a business' viability:
#1 = Market
#2 = Marketing
#3 = Aesthetic
#4 = Functionality

The product with a sizeable market and low competition wins even with bad marketing, a bad aesthetic, and poor functionality.
In the same market, the product with better marketing wins.
In the same market with equal marketing, the product with the better design aesthetic wins.
Functionality, code quality, and documentation are all a distant fourth.
