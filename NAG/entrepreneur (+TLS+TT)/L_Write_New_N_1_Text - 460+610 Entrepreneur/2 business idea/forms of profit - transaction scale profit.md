Real estate woman who only sells $1M+ houses. Paid attention only to that market. What kind of people. Studied for 7 years. You get to the big transactions through great relationships.
NOT: "You take whatever business you can get." (that's what every salesman says about every customer. got to get the revenue, no matter how unprofitable it might be.)
But you can't get to the big transactions just by wanting to : you have to take risks to bias yourself toward the big business. Turn small business away to concentrate on the big accounts.
Needs skill, persistence, reference development. How many doors did you refuse to enter? Drawn to the shiny lure of the next thing that came up. Losing sense of long-term self-interest, strategy, the smart thing to do.
Revenue increases proportionately with transaction volume but materials, construction, and or distribution costs do not.
Examples: Microsoft (Office software), Morgan Stanley (finance deals), Yahoo (website hosting)

################# TRANSACTION SCALE PROFIT

Transaction scale businesses reward those who control the largest transactions.
Customer selection - investing in those customers with the largest deals - is key.
In these businesses - typified by investment banking, real estate, commercial lending, long-distance haulage, long-distance travel, etc. - costs do not rise as rapidly as fees as a function of transaction size.
Two equal market shares - one composed of a hundred small deals, the other of five or six big ones - will not produce equivalent levels of profitability. The latter will be several times more profitable than the former.
The costs incurred by Morgan Stanley to manage a $100 million financing were not dramatically greater than the costs of a $5 million financing.
