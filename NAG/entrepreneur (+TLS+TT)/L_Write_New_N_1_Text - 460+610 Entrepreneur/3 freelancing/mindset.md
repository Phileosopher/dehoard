
For sole traders and very small companies, the distinction between innovation and day-to-day delivery is barely noticeable and unimportant. It's all just business, and creative, responsive, flexible business comes easier to you the smaller your operation.

Faced with a choice of doing a job for the money or doing a job for the
fun of it, take the fun one whenever you can.
You'll rarely enjoy the work you do for money.

If the first commercial version of your work excites no one to action,
it's time to move on to something different. Don't be fooled by the
opinions of friends and family.

If your work inspires some excitement and some action from customers,
get ready to chew through some walls. You might have something worth
fighting for.
