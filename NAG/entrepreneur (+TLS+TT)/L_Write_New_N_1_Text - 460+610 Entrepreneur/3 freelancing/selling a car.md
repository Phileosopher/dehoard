Tips for private sales of a car:

Always set a time for ALL interested parties: "You can come see the car Saturday between Noon and 3PM. Text me when you are at the parking lot" (it's like an sales showroom open house listing, instead of making 5 random scattered appointments. "First come, first served")

"Any test drives require proof of drivers license and proof of auto liability insurance, no exceptions. Otherwise you can be a passenger while i drive, and i reserve the right to have an security escort". (this dissuades car jackers)

"Yes, you can bring your mechanic"

"CASH ONLY, no trades, no checks"

"Car sold as-is, no warranties expressed or implied : i have listed the condition of the car to the best of my knowledge".

This makes all potential buyers arrive at same day, same place, you camp out there for a couple hours: if more than 1 arrives at a time, they might feel like they have to compete against each other.

And don't be afraid to refuse to negotiate a discount, but politely thank them for their interest. Let them know that you will immediately remove the listing when it sells, so if listing is gone, they lost out.

PS: don't list "OBO"/"Or Best Offer" in your price listing. This only invites sight unseen lowballers who waste your time. Q: "What's the lowest price you will accept?" A: "I'm gonna sell it for the price listed." "If you are interested, show up Saturday between Noon and 3PM. Have a nice day!" (Know what your car is worth beforehand, price accordingly, its a hot market for mid-priced used cars nowadays)

And remember: 'Money Talks, Bullshit Walks…'

EDIT: Was a car salesman for many years. Probably consummated over 500 deals.

2nd Edit: oops, yeah, the word 'consummated' subconsciously slipped out… That's ancient car salesman slang, the old-timer salesguys used to say that word because it meant someone got fucked …

Whenever anyone asks me "what's the least you'll take for it" I always respond with "what's the most you'll pay for it?" If they won't answer I just thank them for their time and tell them I'm not interested in selling for the least amount possible.
