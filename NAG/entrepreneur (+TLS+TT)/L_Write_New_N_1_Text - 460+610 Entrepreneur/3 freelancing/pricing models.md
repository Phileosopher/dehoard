A financial planner raised his fees by 40%. The first year following
that increase, his income increased 65%. Today it's up 150%.
A Canadian decorator charged $75/hr for years. Raised her fee to
$125/hr, and the effect was immediate. Inquiries increased, from people
eager to work with the region's "premier interior decorator". Her
conversion rates improved. Once prospects believed they were dealing
with the area's best decorator - the conclusion they came to from her
fee - they were more apt to say, "When can we start?" Sales took less time.
The fee increase also meant her more affluent clientele paid faster,
more willingly, and without fail.
