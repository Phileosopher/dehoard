Marketing advice that Josiah Wedgwood might have given his unsuccessful brother Thomas:
- create new ways of glazing your goods, and novel items that people seek out
- sign your work
- increase your pricing by 400%
- establish high quality standards
- build a bigger factory and put it near a canal, one that you lobbied to have built
- train nonpotters to join your workforce, and design innovative ways to manage them
- organize the factory to reflect a separation of labor
- open showrooms in London and change the stock weekly
- focus on mass production
- sell to the richest people in the world, but avoid taking custom work except for items for heads of state

What consumers have wanted all along : to be treated with respect, and to be connected to other people.

Much promotion doesn't work because just knowing about something isn't the same as being excited about it, using it, or best of all: talking about it.

If you want to be in the commodity business, be my guest. If you want to sell large quantities of cheap stuff, you're welcome to it.
The rest of us, though, are going to grow fast using our knowledge of human nature and the new marketing that allows people to express that nature.
You're doomed to sell a slow-growing commodity only if you want to.
Any product, from a cardboard notebook to an accounting firm, can now be transformed, using the tools that are available to everyone.

Ideas that spread THROUGH groups of people are far more powerful than ideas delivered AT someone.

Create a movement around your product or service. 

We have everything we need, so we're not buying commodities. We're not even buying products. We're buying relationships and stories and magic.

Near the beginning of most comics was a scene where a stranger would meet the team.
Inevitably, the heroes would introduce themselves.
Of course, Batman or Superman wouldn't need an introduction, but the lesser (lower-rent) heroes had to speak up and describe their superpowers.
"I'm the Wasp. I have the ability to shrink to a height of several centimeters, fly by means of insectoid wings, and fire energy blasts."
Some fancy marketers might call this a positioning statement or a unique selling proposition.
Of course, it's not that. It's a superpower.
When you meet someone, you need to have a superpower. If you don't, you're just another handshake.
It's not about touting yourself or coming on too strong. It's about making the introduction meaningful.
If I don't know your superpower, then I don't know how you can help me (or I can help you).

When what you do is what you love, you're able to invest more effort and care and time. That means you're more likely to win, to gain share, to profit.
On the other hand, poets don't get paid.
Even worse, poets who try to get paid end up writing jingles and failing and hating it at the same time.

Attention doesn't always equal significant cash flow.
I think it makes sense to make your art your art, to give yourself over to it without regard for commerce.

Maybe you can't make money doing what you love (at least what you love right now). But I bet you can figure out how to love what you do to make money (if you choose wisely).
Do your art. But don't wreck your art if it doesn't lend itself to paying the bills. That would be a tragedy.

John Jantsch took an interview he did with me (about forty minutes of audio) and posted it to a site that uses the Turk as its labor. For just a few dollars, the site took the recording, chopped it into tiny bits, and parceled it out to anonymous laborers who each transcribed their little section. Less than three hours later, it was sewn back together and the typed transcript was delivered to John. Instead of paying the industry rate of two dollars a minute (about eighty dollars), services like CastingWords do transcription for less than fifty cents a minute using the Turk. 

The Virgin brand is a guarantee that you'll be treated well, that you'll get a high-quality product which won't dent your bank balance, and you'll get more fun out of your purchase than you expected - whatever it is.

THE BEST WAY TO MARKET A PRODUCT IS TO SHOW IT
- A GREAT WAY TO USE A DEMO IS TO HAVE A FULLY-FLEDGED PRODUCT, WHICH RESETS AND REINSTALLS EVERY 4-6 HOURS
- THAT WAY, EVERYONE SEES IT BUT NOBODY CAN ACTUALLY CREATE PRODUCTIVE WORK WITH IT WITHOUT PROPERLY GETTING IT

OLD tPA: Marketing
- Build for your actual market - don't start into an industry you haven't worked with before
- The way you present your business should be a reflection of your audience - consider your clients and carefully tailor the pitch for them
- Understand how social media networks work - using a communication channel wrong will many times do more harm than good

I did a little pro bono consulting with the Arizona Chapter of the Arthritis Foundation about securing more, new corporate sponsors for their telethon. The Foundation couldn't get the key CEOs it wanted to talk with to give them the time of day. That's because Foundation representatives were talking about the Arthritis Foundation. I created a new message aimed at these CEOs-telling them about new, creative, very-low cost opportunities to get massive, prestigious public recognition for their companies featuring prime TV advertising at about 25 cents on the dollar vs. what they would normally pay. I created a letter that played to their egos, presented a logical case, had something new to offer, and hit the fear button-that their competitors might beat them out for an exclusive. Some of these busy CEOs called the very same day they got my letter. Companies such as Federal Express and Domino's Pizza raced to get involved.
- IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FRAMING AND WIIFM

Norman Augustine's Law Number IV: If you can afford to advertise, you don't need to.

Don't think you're building a brand - you're not Coca-Cola or Johnson & Johnson.
The minute those users leave your site you are out of their minds forever.
