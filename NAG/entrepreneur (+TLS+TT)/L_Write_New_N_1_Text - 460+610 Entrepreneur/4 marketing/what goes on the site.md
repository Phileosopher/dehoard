The #1 goal of your home page is to convince your visitors to click a link.
That's all you have to do to convince them not to leave is click a single link.
Half of all home page visitors leave without clicking a single link.
The solution? A simple home page with very few options, and large, clickable buttons.

If you choose to have an image for your home page, choose one that shows the result of your product.

Your hook is your four-second sales pitch and it should be the headline of your home page. These are 5-7 word summaries of your product.
It's the single sentence that grabs the reader in and makes her know she's in the right place.
DotNetInvoice's hook is "Save Time. Get Paid Faster."
FogBugz's hook is "Bring Your Project into Focus"
Basecamp's hook is "The Better Way to Get Projects Done"
Bidsketch's hook is "Simple Proposal Software Made for Designers"
iPod's hook was "One Thousand Songs in Your Pocket"
