
Time Vampires love meetings, because a bunch of blood-rich victims gather in one place at one time. It's like a buffet.

I had an open-door policy at the office for a while. An endless parade of Time Vampires. Suck, suck, suck. By the end of the day, my neck looked like a pincushion. They just lined up, marched in, and happily took turns siphoning me dry. I put out the vampire welcome mat, and they took me up on the invitation. My fault, of course.

A VIP list with more than two dozen people on it is not a VIP list at all.
