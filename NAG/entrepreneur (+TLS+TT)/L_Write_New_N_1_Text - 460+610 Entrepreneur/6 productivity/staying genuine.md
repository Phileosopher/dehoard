
OLD tPA: The Product
- You may think your product is perfect, but your clients won't - your opinion may not be the best one, listen to user feedback
- Undercharging is not sustainable - focus on quality, expertise and niche focus instead of price, since any idiot can undersell
- When you think you've tested your product enough, test it some more - never release a product until it has been tested exhaustively by people who don't work for you
- If your company sells a variety of products, make sure you know how to use/operate every single one of them - it helps you look at things with fresh eyes

Steve Wozniak:
Have the higest of ethics. Be open and truthful about things, not hiding. Don't mislead people.
Always seek excellence : make your product better than the average person would.

Evan Williams:
What kills great things is compromise - letting people talk you out of what your gut is telling you.

Establish a culture of execution in the early days. The CEO should set an example of meeting goals, responding to customers, and heeding and measuring employees. This obsession should include the CEO's answering emails and responding to phone calls.

Better clients demand better work.
Better clients want you to push the envelope, win awards, and challenge
their expectations.
Better clients pay on time.
Better clients talk about you and your work.
But finding better clients isn't easy, partly because we don't trust
ourselves enough to imagine that we deserve them.
