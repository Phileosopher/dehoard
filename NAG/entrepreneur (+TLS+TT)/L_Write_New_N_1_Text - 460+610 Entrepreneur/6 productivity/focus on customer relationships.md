- Be grateful - appreciate the loyal customers, advocates of your brand are priceless in value
- Look after those who look after you - give under-the-radar referral bonuses and perks to loyal people
- Get paid before you hand over a project to a client - you lose bargaining power when you turn the project over to the client
- It's not a sale until it's paid for - do not become excited about prospective clients until they've paid for the service
- You'll make more money being "wrong" than proving you are right - it's more cost-effective to lose a dissatisfied customer than spend resources trying to retain them, they're not the ideal client and that's okay
- Agree on scope in advance - have a clear contract before work begins, charge for a project going beyond the plan

Sabeer Bhatia:
The one lesson I've learned is you've got to own the customer. It's OK if you don't monetize them up front, but having that customer base and being able to upsell them services or advertise - you can always make money off of them.
Make sure you write a business plan because it will crystallize your thoughts to communicate your ideas with somebody else. Once written, have someone critique it and ask you questions.
Don't try to change user behavior dramatically. Make it a small change, yet an important one.
