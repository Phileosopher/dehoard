- Be passionate about your work - wake up every day ready and eager to do business
- You can't do everything on your own - you need a team to carry the weight that will come as time progresses
- Believe in yourself - you're selling yourself, not the product, and people want genuine boldness and confidence
- Do one thing really well - specialize in order to provide better service to who is being specialized to
- Don't expect to be an overwhelming success right away - even at the low points you will still be growing and learning

"My life is one long obstacle course, with me being the chief obstacle." -JACK PAAR

It is 6:00 A.M. And here I am, at the keyboard, in my home office, writing. That's what I do almost every day, for at least the first early hour of the morning, no matter what.

Self-discipline is the magic power that makes you virtually unstoppable. Self-discipline is MAGNETIC. And self-discipline aimed and applied at a particular thing, as I do to writing, as Pincay does to fitness, is quite literally a magic power. When you focus your self-discipline on a single purpose, like sunlight through a magnifying glass on a single object, look out! The whole world will scramble to get out of your way, hold the doors open for you, and salute as you walk by. It takes tremendous self-discipline to productively allocate and invest time and to stick to your intentions.

Because the entrepreneur is his own boss and can do as he pleases with his time, it is very important to be self-disciplined. The entrepreneur with a loose, buddy-buddy, easily forgiving boss will never accomplish much. It is the entrepreneur with the tough taskmaster as a boss who excels.

The only constraint of a company's growth and potential is the owner's ambition. I am the constraint. The market, the opportunity, everything is there. It's up to me to set the pace, clear the obstacles, get the resources, and create the conversations to grow the company faster.

As CEO, the most important thing I manage is myself. Do that right, and everything else falls into place.

Once you dig (find someone or something you like), keep drilling - go deeper.
