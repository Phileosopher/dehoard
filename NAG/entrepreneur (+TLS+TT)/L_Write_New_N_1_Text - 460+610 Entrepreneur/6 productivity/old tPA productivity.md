
### Focus every dollar into making the most profitable sales

Avoid impulse spending near the beginning
- Carefully assess every dollar you spend
- Sponsoring conferences to appear large isn't cost-effective
- Cut out any expenses that don't create results as much as you expected

You're selling yourself, not the product, and your personality will close deals
- You must tailor each product sales pitch to each potential client
- Loyal customers have more value than money, so advertise and celebrate them with referral bonuses and perks

A startup budget doesn't have any room for a hit-or-miss marketing strategy
- Only sell to a familiar market since an unfamiliar one will cause massive losses
- Use social media networks intentionally since a wrongly used channel might be worse than not using it
- Trying to keep dissatisfied customers is less cost-effective than losing them and working to gain new ones

Only hand the customer the product after the customer paid you
- The person holding the product always has bargaining power
- The customer hasn't bought the product until they pay for it, so only use lines of credit as a backup plan if they don't pay

#### Micromanage vendor relationships

Take pictures of business cards people hand you just in case you lose them

Trust your gut instincts with them

Rate your vendors and suppliers correctly
- Make performance indicators
- Classify every supplier and vendor
- Determine who has more power and influence
- Maintain good relationships with everyone
- Sever weak links
