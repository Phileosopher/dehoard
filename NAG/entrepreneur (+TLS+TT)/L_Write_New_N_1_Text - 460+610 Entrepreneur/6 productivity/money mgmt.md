
OLD tPA: Managing Finances
- Patience and flexibility help you survive the lean times - scale slowly to avoid debt
- Save up - you can operate at a loss for several years but can only run out of cash once, have a rainy day fund with 2-3 months' worth of operating costs in it and a line of credit even if you don't plan to use it
- Keep re-investing - put as much back into the business as you physically can

Joe Kraus:
Hire slowly and more carefully.
Be cheap, cheap, cheap.
Get the legs of the business underneath it before you run terribly fast. Take the time to understand the dynamics of the business so we can scale it.
