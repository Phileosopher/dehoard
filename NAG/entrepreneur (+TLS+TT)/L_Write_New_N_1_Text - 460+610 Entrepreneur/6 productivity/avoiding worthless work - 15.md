Reduce. Do as little as possible to get what you have to get done. Do less of it - get it done.
If you've got two things you want to put together, take away until they go together. Don't add another thing.
Because you can understand it better, you can analyze it more cleanly.
Doing less is so important.

You want to be very aware, all the time, of the passing of time.

(Decide how much you want to make, and divide it into your price-per-hour : your "governing number".)

If the $340.92 were MY governing number, here's how I would have to use it.
First, it'd be on my mind constantly. Is what I'm doing worth $340.92 an hour to do it?
Second, it puts a meter on others' consumption of your time-that unnecessary 12-minute phone conversation just cost $68.18.

An attorney I know charges:
a higher fee to personally handle your case
a lower fee to supervise the handling of your case by his staff attorneys
yet a lower fee to only consult with your attorney regarding your case.

You've got to surround yourself with people who understand and respect the value of your time and behave accordingly.

Eliminate the need for doing or delegate those tasks and activities that just cannot and do not match up with the mandated value of your time.

If your time isn't worth more than the $5 an hour you could give some neighborhood kid to do menial tasks (mowing lawn), you should be shot. Plus, you're robbing some kid out of the money.

Be a business owner instead of being owned by a business.

The less I do, the more I make.

Anytime you're on your computer ask yourself "Is this activity getting me closer to my launch date?"

At this very moment am I making progress towards crossing off a to-do, -or- am I relaxing and re-energizing? If I'm doing neither, evaluate the situation and change it.

Define a long-term goal (launch your product), look at the next set of tasks that will get you one step closer to that goal, work, and re-evaluate in a week.

The faster you fail and learn from your mistakes, the faster you will improve.

Using a tool like SlimTimer, track every minute you spend working on your product, broken down into development, support and marketing. This allows you to monetize your time.
