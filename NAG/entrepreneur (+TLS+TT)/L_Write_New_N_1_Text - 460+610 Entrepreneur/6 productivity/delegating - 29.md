Good enough is good enough. Many, many things can be delegated to people who will not do them the way you would, won't do them as perfectly as you would, but will wind up with the same result. Every one of these things should be delegated. In fact, you MUST delegate. You cannot move ahead without jettisoning some responsibilities and tasks in order to make room for new, more valuable tasks and responsibilities.

If you have anybody around you with intelligence and talent, you must keep giving them new, more important responsibilities and getting them to delegate.

You MUST master this difficult skill. To delegate effectively, here's the seven-step process:
1. Define what is to be done.
2. Be certain the delegatee understands what is to be done.
3. Explain why it is to be done as you are prescribing it to be done.
4. Teach how it is to be done without micro-micro-managing.
5. Be sure the delegatee understands the how-to process.
6. Set the deadline for completion or progress report.
7. Be sure you have agreement to the date or time and method.

Many entrepreneurs are so busy doing the $10.00-an-hour jobs, they never get to do the $100.00-an-hour job: marketing to bring in new customers, and to keep customers coming back.
- THIS IS THE ASPECT OF OPPORTUNITY COST: DO WHAT YOU ARE [SPECIALIZED] AT
There are a lot of people you can hire to make the sauce, but there's hardly anybody you can hire to effectively market and promote the restaurant.

My "Dan as Center of Universe Strategy": me in the middle and satellite businesses owned and managed by others all based on me, my writings, my other content, all paying me. Right now, there are four such satellites.

The action that turns your time into the most money and wealth possible: turn your attention to marketing. Get free of as many other aspects of your business as you can, get passionately interested in and good at marketing, and invest your time there. Why? Because it is infinitely easier to find or train someone to take care of a business' operations than it is to get someone to do its marketing. Marketing is the highestpaid profession and most valuable part of a business. The person who can create systems for acquiring customers, clients, or patients effectively and profitably is the "money person."

One of the most important things to me is a continuous stream of new requests for my services. As long as this demand for "me" exceeds the available supply of "me," I can demand and get premium fees, insist on first-class travel, choose clients I like and blow off those I don't, choose projects that interest me and reject those I don't, confidently turn away business knowing the temporary vacuum will fill, and generally do as I darned well please. But if I let the demand diminish so that supply exceeds demand, I have to start compromising all over the place. So this is very important to me. What can I do every day to be certain this demand-supply ratio stays weighted in my favor? I do not let a day go by that I do not send out a letter or a package, make or return a phone call, get an article published, do something to keep my books on bookstore shelves, secure a highprofile speaking engagement, or do something else to create and stimulate "deal flow."

Two overriding supervisory rules that you'll want to remember.
1. Expect the best. Expectations have enormous impact on results. And conveyed expectations have great impact on most people. Most folks are smarter and more capable than we give them credit for. Some never get challenged.
2. Know that you only have the right to expect what you inspect.

For each person you delegate to, have a list of everything, big or small, that you turn over to that person. As each one responds, you can mark off the items. Every so often, check the list for the lagging items.

Procrastination is your body telling you that you need to back off a bit
and think more about what you are doing. It could also mean you are
doing work that is not your forte and that you are better off
delegating. I find that many entrepreneurs are trying to do everything
when it would be cheaper and more time-efficient to delegate,

Don't get involved with functions that are not in your circle of competency or strength. It doesn't do you any good, and it certainly won't make your ride any easier.

If you'd rather be anywhere than doing your great work on a Saturday morning, then you're probably doing the wrong thing or looking at it the wrong way.

Get enough sales going so you can quit taking out the trash and hire someone else to do it. Get more sales going, then quit doing the accounting. Hire a specialist to do it. Get more sales going and quit doing customer service, too. You want to go from everything to nothing - except leading.

The big secret of how to get it all done? Don't. Just do the vital functions (amazingly well) and build a great team of capable players who are excellent at the rest.

So I bought a stopwatch and wore it around my neck all day. I turned it on every time I did one of those vital three functions and turned it off the split second I stopped. Can you guess what that (evil) stopwatch said? Less than 20 minutes out of a 16-hour day.

Success has less to do with what we can get ourselves to do and more to do with keeping ourselves from doing what we shouldn't.

An inbox actually is the modern day mailroom! (So don't work in the mailroom.)

Delegation requires humility. A recognition that you aren't the only one who can do something well, quickly, and competently. Stop being a narcissist and let go.

He's figured out his one vital function. What's yours? What's your one thing that contributes the most to your enterprise? What is your greatest contribution to making your rocket ship fly?

"The client will pay whatever it takes," we said. "How much would it cost for Sir Richard to attend?" Here's the response from his office: "No amount of money would matter. Right now, Richard has three strategic priorities he is focused on, and he will only allow us to allocate his calendar to something that significantly contributes to the accomplishment of one of those three priorities, and speaking for a fee is not one of them."

If you have more than three priorities, you don't have any.

Warren Buffett's key to success: "For every hundred great opportunities that are brought to me, I say 'no' ninety-nine times."

Make sure that the next time you consider saying "yes" (when you really should be saying "no"), it's a "Hell Yeah!" or don't even consider it.

"Why do you do what you do?" I was quick to respond, "Impact. To positively impact people's lives and futures." A: "Then measure that."

Before I start any task I ask myself: "Could one of my contractors possibly do this?"

One of the biggest adjustments is accepting that time is your most precious commodity.

If you value your time at $100/hour, outsourcing work to a $6/hour virtual assistant is a no-brainer.
Putting a value on your time is a foundational step in becoming an entrepreneur, and it's one many entrepreneurs never take. Skipping this step can result in late nights performing menial tasks you should be outsourcing.

> As your company grows you have to get used to the fact that you cannot be involved in all the aspects of the company. To delegate is hard
> Delegating, he said, is another tough thing to do. “The key is to hire people who are more intelligent than you, to find people who are super, super smart, ”
