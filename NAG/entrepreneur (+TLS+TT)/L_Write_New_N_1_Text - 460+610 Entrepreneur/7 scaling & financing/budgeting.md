
You can improve cash flow by observing the following suggestions in a start-up's early days:
- Keep payroll down to an absolute minimum. Overhead walks on two legs.
- Never sign long-term rent agreements or take upmarket office space.
- Never buy a business meal if the other side offers to.
- Pay yourself just enough to eat.
- Issuing staff credit cards, company cell phones, or cars is the road to ruin.
- Play one supplier against another, ruthlessly. They want your business.
- Only enter a factoring deal in absolute extremity. Exit it fast.
