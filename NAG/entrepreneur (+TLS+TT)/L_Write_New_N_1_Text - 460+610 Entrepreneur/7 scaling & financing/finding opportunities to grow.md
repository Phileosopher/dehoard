
Never stop asking what you can do that other organizations _can't_ compete on.
- Almost every perceived weakness you have represents a hidden strength:
    - Small means you can change faster.
    - Low-knowledge means you'll have unconventional solutions
    - Unable to scale means VERY specific people are devoted to you

Don't lose sight of the big question: Are there barriers to entry that allow us to do things that other firms cannot?

Great business design is a combination of superb knowledge about customers and profit ("You can't intuit the facts"), together with great strategic imagination.
The reinventors' unique skill is strategic creativity: constantly reversing traditional assumptions, developing new options, and making more inspired choices.

Must be reinvented as customers' needs and priorities change and as value migrates away from the industry's traditional business designs.
Just as products become technologically obsolete, business designs become economically obsolete.
Over time, because of the competitive nature of business, most business designs are no longer allowed to make a profit.

Lew Platt, CEO of Hewlett-Packard, has an invaluable perspective on reinventing: "The single biggest problem in business is staying with your previously successful business model one year too long."

When companies succeed, a company's center of gravity moves.

If a skill is relevant to the customer and is not currently offered, the company must develop it, or hire it, or acquire it, or license it, or find a business partner who will provide it.

1. Who are the most profitable customers?
2. Within that group, which customers have the highest profit growth potential?
3. What mix and level of investments are needed to meet those customers' needs efficiently and enable profit growth to occur?
In many companies, this profitability analysis has revealed that 10 to 15 percent of the customer base is unprofitable, consisting of buyers who absorb the company's resources and do not provide a return.

Move your company into the profit zone. The process involves addressing a sequence of twelve questions:
1. Who are my customers?
  - Identifying customers really means being able to categorize them into distinct groups whose behavior can be analyzed accurately.
  - try to segment your customers into different groups - for instance, by behavior or by priority.
  - Coke's Major Customer Groups 1. Consumers 2. Fountain and Vending Customers 3. Anchor Bottlers 4. National Chains
  - Understand their priorities.
  - Deciphering the priorities that are guiding your customers' behavior.
  - Name three products or services in your industry that have become popular over the past 2 years.
    - Why did customers like them?
    - What were the underlying reasons for the products' value?
    - Did they save money?
    - Reduce hassle?
    - Offer security?
  - Repeat the above exercise but substitute an unrelated market or industry where your customers are actively engaged.
    - What preferences do they express in that market?
  - To discover what your customers' silent or unspoken priorities are is to consider the entire economic system in which your customers operate.
  - Imagine yourself as the CEO of each of your five most important customers (or as a head of household in your five most important demographic groups).
    - What would your overall objectives be?
    - What major concerns would you have?
    - How could a supplier help you toward your goals?
    - How is the supplier currently hindering you?
2. How are their priorities changing?
  - Changing customer priorities in the coffee industry (a priority shift away from price to quality, leading to a shift from grocery retail brands to specialty coffee stores) allowed Starbuck's to prosper.
  - Look at the other industries where your customers operate.
    - Do you see any trends that may soon appear in your market?
    - If customers are trying to save time in one of those areas, aren't they likely to value saved time in yours?
    - What advantages can you introduce now, or in the near future, to anticipate your customers' preferences or needs?
3. Who should be my customer?
  - Are there new groups who would value what you do?
    - Can you jump a step along the value chain and serve your customers' customers?
    - Can you step in the other direction and become a supplier to other companies like your own?
  - Innovative customer selection was critical to value creation for each of the reinventors.
  - Roberto Goizueta realized that Coca-Cola had always thought of consumers as its target customers, when, in fact, bottlers were the buyers of Coca-Cola's syrup and controlled the commercial availability of Coke beverages. He reoriented the company to see bottlers as the key customers in the system and began organizational reform that led to Coca-Cola's low-cost distribution system.
4. How can I add value to the customer?
  - A business earns no profit when customers are willing to pay only the total cost of a product.
  - Each company must ask itself: "What special benef it of our product will compel customers to pay us a premium?"
  - The answer will always say, in some form: "Customers will pay us a premium if we meet their priorities, which are X, Y, and Z."
    - Which priorities are your competitors satisfying?
    - Which priorities might you be able to serve better than your competitors can?
    - Which priorities might you satisfy at a lower cost than your competitorsare charging?
    - How large a premium will your customers pay to have each of their priorities met?
    - Which set of priorities can you serve simultaneously in order to provide the most value for your customers?
5. How can I become the customer's first choice?
  - Who is your most important customer?
  - What are that customer's top three priorities?
  - How do you score?
  - How does your best competitor score?
6. What is my profit model?
  - A business design that adds value to the customer but is not designed to create high profitability is an incomplete - and in many cases, a fatally defective - business design.
    - Do any of these models apply to your business?
    - Does more than one apply?
    - Which ones?
  - How does high profit happen in my business?
    - Who is the most profitable company in my business, and why?
  - Is there a picture that captures how profitability works in your business?
    - Can you sketch it?
    - What is on the X-axis? Time? Scale?
    - How do the different pieces of your business relate to one another?
  - Does everybody in my organization understand our profit model?
    - Does the organization align its actions to create the conditions that will achieve high profitability?
    - Do we make decisions and allocate resources based on this understanding?
7. What is my current business design?
  - A company's business design is composed of four strategic elements:
    (1) customer selection
    (2) value capture
    (3) strategic control
    (4) scope
  - Examples of business design options:
    - Customer Selection All segments Segment 1 Segment 2 Downstream customers
    - Value capture Revenue per unit Licensing fees Service revenue Solutions revenue
    - Strategic Control Brand Low Cost 2-year lead Customer relationship
    - Scope Broad line Narrow line Fully integrated Virtual
8. Who are my real competitors?
  - your true competitors are any companies that share your customers and/or your scope. Your competitors may be in industries that are different from yours. They may provide a completely different set of products and services.
  - What companies are not competitors yet, but could be in the next year or two?
9. What is my toughest competitors' business design?
10. What is my next business design?
  - A business design that is well aligned with customers' priorities will be in a state of value inflow
11. What is my strategic control point?
  - Strategic control points:
    - brand
    - patent
    - copyright
    - 2-year product development lead
    - 20 percent cost advantage
    - control of distribution
    - control of supply
    - owning customer information flow
    - a unique organizational culture
    - value chain control
    - and others.
  - Each one is designed to keep a company in the profit zone and to prevent others from stealing away the profitability.
  - Where would your company be situated on a strategic control point index?
  - Where would your competitors be placed?
  - What can you do to increase your company's strategic control index?
  - How would your profitability increase if you increased your degree of strategic control?
12. What is my company worth?
  - What is my profit model?
  - What is my strategic control point or points?
  - These are two of the most important questions in business today.
  - They determine how profitable we will be, and how long that profitability might last.
