
Capital - Money that business owners invest to acquire assets and start operating, also known as Start-Up Costs

Take the cash and momentum you get from being at the Local Max (big fish small pond), and invest a fraction of it into a new smaller team without traditional constraints that will launch something new and disruptive. Even something that competes.
Local Max companies make 2 big mistakes:
1 - believing they can get to the next Max in a linear, pain-free way
2 - believing the best way to get there is with brute force (more products, salespeople, ads, buildings, staff)
The opposite is true. The more you coddle your new team, the harder it will be for them to find the new Max.

"Seed money" also encourages people to give more to charities.
Seed money refers to the practice of lining up major grants in advance,
before announcing a "capital campaign" to raise a certain sum of money,
often as high as $100 million or more.
The seed money shows that prestigious and wealthy donors are already
committed to the cause.
When the initial seed money is high, the subsequent fund-raising tends
to go very well.
One of List's experiments found that raising seed money from 10 to 67
percent leads to a nearly sixfold increase in subsequent contributions.
Like a matching grant, seed money signals that the charity is part of a
powerful and noble endeavor; the charity is the winning team, so to speak.

Ask funders for money, and they'll give you advice; but ask for advice and they'll give you money.

Money is overrated. Truly new things rarely need an abundance of money. If that was so, billionaires would have a monopoly on inventing new things, and they don't. Instead almost all breakthroughs are made by those who lack money, because they are forced to rely on their passion, persistence and ingenuity to figure out new ways. Being poor is an advantage in innovation.

People with an idea ask me, "Should I raise VC money yet?" NO, of course
not! First you have to hustle.

It is often easier to raise money or acquire other resources when you have zero revenue, zero customers, and zero traction than when you have a small amount. Zero invites imagination, but small numbers invite questions about whether large numbers will ever materialize. Everyone knows (or thinks he or she knows) stories of products that achieved breakthrough success overnight. As long as nothing has been released and no data have been collected, it is still possible to imagine overnight success in the future. Small numbers pour cold water on that hope.
