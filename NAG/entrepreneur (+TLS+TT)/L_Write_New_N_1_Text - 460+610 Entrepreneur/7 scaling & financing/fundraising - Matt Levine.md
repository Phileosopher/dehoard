## AI disruption

I think there is something charming about Sam Altman's [frequent public insistence](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0) that building good artificial intelligence models will cost more than, like, everything else in the history of human civilization combined. "Oh, just out doing a roadshow to raise a few trillion dollars for chips," Altman shrugs. It feels like a clever strategy? Like:

1. If you get everyone thinking that it will cost trillions of dollars to build AI, then a lot of potential competitors won't even bother; there's no way they could raise that kind of money.
2. If you go to the UAE or Masayoshi Son or whomever and are like "I'm looking for $7 trillion," maybe that will anchor their expectations high enough that they're like "well we can't do that, but we're in for a more modest ticket, would $7 billion help," and then you've got $7 billion, which is actually a lot.
3. It fits nicely with Altman's [other strategy](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-01-18/coinbase-trades-beanie-babies) of suggesting that AI, if mishandled, could destroy humanity: That self-aggrandizing claim is more plausible if it also comes with an enormous price tag.
4. It's gotta help with recruiting, throwing around numbers like that.

OpenAI is a relatively young company (and [a nonprofit](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-27/openai-is-still-an-86-billion-nonprofit)!), and while by many measures (valuation, money raised so far, revenue) it is quite large, it also does a good job of giving the _impression_ of hugeness, and part of that comes from Altman going around always saying the biggest possible number.

But I suppose that does create an opportunity for [someone with a contrarian view](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-9-month-old-ai-startup-challenging-silicon-valleys-giants-ee2e4c48):

> [Arthur] Mensch's startup, called Mistral AI, is challenging the conventional wisdom that the winners of the AI race will emerge from among the tech industry's U.S. giants. Mensch, who founded the company with two engineering-school friends, doesn't think enormous scale is essential - or that the U.S. will necessarily dominate. …
> 
> Mensch's company, which has raised just over $500 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, remains tiny compared with the Goliaths of the industry. Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Alphabet's Google are pouring billions of dollars into training the latest AI systems, leveraging their access to the specialized computer chips needed to build such systems and the fat balance sheets needed to pay for the electricity those chips consume. 
> 
> Mistral, named for a strong wind that blows from France, is founded in part on the idea that a lot of that money is being wasted. …
> 
> "We want to be the most capital-efficient company in the world of AI," Mensch said. "That's the reason we exist." …
> 
> Mensch said his new model cost less than €20 million, the equivalent of roughly $22 million, to train. By contrast OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman said last year after the release of GPT-4 that training his company's biggest models cost "much more than" $50 million to $100 million.

In general, we are coming out of many years of venture capital exuberance in which saying "we are competing to build a world-changing technology, and we're going to win by spending slightly less money than our competitors" was _not_ a particularly appealing pitch: The [whole](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-31/don-t-blitzscale-against-yourself) [game](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-07/moviepass-was-not-a-good-business) was to spend freely now to win market dominance later. But now interest rates are higher, and also surely there is _some_ cap on that? "We will build world-changing technology for less than $7 trillion" _is_ kind of a good pitch.

## Reddit IPO

Reddit Inc. is planning an initial public offering of its stock. In a typical IPO, a company and its early investors sell stock to institutional investors at the IPO price, and then the next day the stock opens for trading and regular investors can buy it (from those institutions). Usually - not always - the stock goes up on that first day of trading, as everyone who wants to own the stock, but could not get any in the IPO, buys it. This is called the "IPO pop," and institutional investors try to get into the good graces of IPO issuers (and their banks) so they can get good allocations in hot IPOs and benefit from the pop.

Reddit will mostly sell stock to institutional investors, but it plans to [sell some of the shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm#i1b9a579e78a34dfa99f7f26daeec195b_112) to "eligible Reddit users and moderators." I suppose this is a sort of a loyalty program, letting Reddit's most active users buy stock at the IPO price and participate in some of the upside. I [wrote a bit](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-02-21/reddit-s-ipo-is-for-redditors) about this plan last week. Here's how Reddit [describes it](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm#i1b9a579e78a34dfa99f7f26daeec195b_112):

> Users and moderators who created an account on or before January 1, 2024 are potentially eligible for the directed share program. Eligible participants must reside in the United States and be at least 18 years of age. Further, eligible users and moderators must be in good standing on our platform and cannot be a current or former Reddit employee.
> 
> We will invite users and moderators to participate in the directed share program in six phased priority tiers. We will assign each eligible participant to a tier based on that participant's contributions to Reddit. User contributions will be measured in karma (a user's reputation score that reflects their community contributions). Moderator contributions will be measured by membership and moderator actions on our platform. Tier 1 will include certain users and moderators identified by us who have meaningfully contributed to Reddit community programs. Tier 2 will include users who hold at least 200,000 karma and moderators who have performed at least 5,000 moderator actions.

And so on down to Tier 6. "An invitation to participate in the directed share program does not guarantee that the participant will receive an allocation of shares," and there's not a lot of description about how the allocations will work. But I suppose if you have a lot of Reddit karma then there's at least a decent chance you can buy some shares at the IPO price.

Also, separately, Reddit plans to sell some of the IPO shares "to retail investors through Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, SoFi Securities, Inc., and Robinhood Financial LLC, as selling group members for this offering, through their respective brokerage platforms." So even non-redditor retail investors can probably buy stock at the IPO price. As I wrote last time, you might expect this sort of thing to reduce the IPO pop: If enthusiastic retail investors can buy at the IPO price, they won't have to buy in the open market the next day, reducing demand for the shares. But I suppose it depends on how much they get in the IPO.

One question is: If you are a retail investor and a redditor, and you have at least 200,000 karma and 5,000 moderator actions on Reddit, how much is that _worth_? You have, not a golden ticket or anything, but at least an inside track to buy an uncertain number of shares of a high-profile IPO at the IPO price. That … probably  has some slight positive expectation, right? You'd rather have that than not? It is … transferable-ish? A reader emailed:

> Today I was given the opportunity to participate in the Reddit IPO as someone who has wasted far too much time on the site. Unfortunately, I am a Canadian and thus forbidden from participating. But Reddit doesn't know that, which is why they offered me the option. So I could sell my account, one of 75,000, to someone who meets the criteria - a purely hypothetical scenario, of course.

Obviously this is not allowed by Reddit's [terms of service](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement), but on the other hand Reddit accounts really are pretty anonymous, so maybe it would work. How much would you charge? How much would you pay? My reader adds:

> What if they change my password and start posting terrible takes all over the site? Will the money be worth losing internet points?

My sense is that, if you are a redditor with lots of karma, the value of this directed share program is probably in the … tens of dollars? Whereas the value of your Reddit reputation is … priceless? Like, you have worked hard to build up all that karma, and you're not going to sacrifice it by transferring your account to someone who just wants a slight advantage in stock trading. 

Also it is not clear how much value _actual Reddit users_ place on the right to buy the stock. Elizabeth Lopatto [reports at the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/24/24081441/reddit-shares-redditor-ipo-user-risk):

> Here's the thing: Redditors aren't enthused about it.
> 
> "Short … it," wrote one r/Wall StreetBets user. "They have not proven that this user base or data set can be monetized." 
> 
> And there was this person: "Loads puts into the put-cannon with malicious intent."

If Reddit power users can sell their rights to buy in the IPO, there might be a lot of supply.
