HIRING MISTAKE: Someone shows belief in our grand plan, we want to believe in them. We are major suckers for someone, anyone, who shows enthusiasm for our cause. Entrepreneurs see the potential in everything and everyone, and we are happy to hire on hope alone.

You can't hire enthusiasm. You need to hire evidence. Recruit people who already have, by evidence. This means being extremely rational and pragmatic. Hire evidence, not hope.

The average "good" employee simply isn't all that productive. The average cost of a bad hire is about 6 to 15 times the person's annual salary.

Great employees can set you free. Free from the things you aren't good at. Free from the things you hate. Free from the daily "emergencies" and decisions that shouldn't consume your days, but always seem to.

Great employees truly are incredible, and they make your life easier and your business better in every way.

A-players want to work with other A-players! You might be thinking you can't afford to hire A-Players. Good news: they're free! Because A-Players pay for themselves.

The single most important thing you need to do is pick the right people and keep them. There is NOTHING more important than this.

Know what you want.

Always be the dumbest one in the room.

"if I have a better idea than my Marketing Director, we are in trouble. If I solve a problem my CFO has been stumped with for a week, we are doomed."

Don't train your people to be successful. Hire successful people.

Warren Buffett looks for: integrity, intelligence, and energy. And he warns that if they don't have that first quality, the others will work against you.

What attributes do you want?

Never even list the compensation plan. I always just say, "much better than market standard."

What makes work fun is doing meaningful work.

Hire ahead of your growth. Hire to conquer new frontiers. Hire to launch new initiatives. But don't hire to put out a fire.

We are a team, not a family. Hire, develop, and cut smartly so we have stars in every position.

Watch out for enthusiasts without experience; they are often better customers than workers.

If a job similar to the one you are filling isn't listed on an applicant's resume, tread carefully. People who haven't held similar positions in the past might not know enough about themselves to realize they won't be happy.

Use education in reverse: hire, conditional on an equal set of skills, the person with the least label-oriented education. It means that the person had to succeed in spite of the credentialization of his competitors and overcome more serious hurdles. In addition, people who didn't go to Harvard are easier to deal with in real life.
