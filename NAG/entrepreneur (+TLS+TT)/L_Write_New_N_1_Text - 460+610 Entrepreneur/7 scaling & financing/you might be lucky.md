I was smart enough to realize I was getting lucky.

The number-one killer of start-ups is when entrepreneurs confuse "being lucky" with "being smart."
You must possess the humility to distinguish one from the other.

There is a pseudo-scientific formula for creating business luck. And the key element is this:
Lucky things happen to entrepreneurs who start fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive companies.
Why?
Because lots of smart people will gather around companies with these qualities.
As it turns out, precious few of them exist.
And the vast majority of human beings, and certainly most of the smart ones, are constitutionally caring creatures who would, if given the chance, prefer to spend their valuable time in a positive setting contributing to the betterment of society rather than in a negative setting contributing to its detriment.
Shocking, I know, but true.
And when smart, inspired people gather around a fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive company, they work very hard.
And when smart, inspired people work very hard, serendipity ensues.
Serendipity-the faculty of making fortuitous discoveries by chance-causes lots of unexpected things to happen to a company.
Some of these unexpected things are good. Some are bad.
But because no one planned for the good things to happen, they appear as luck.
In other words, the best way to ensure that lucky things happen is to make sure that a lot of things happen.
It's really that simple.

My formula for getting lucky in business is reasonably simple:
Start a company that is fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive.
Create an aura of authenticity around your start-up by carefully crafting your mission and communicating it with charisma and passion.
Your company will quickly attract smart, inspired people who will work very hard.
Treat all these people fairly.
Provide them with a clear action plan and give them the latitude to exercise their creativity.

In applying this formula, the entrepreneur has two tasks:
1. Create an environment where smart people will gather
2. Be smart enough to stay out of the way and let luck happen.

Much of what makes a company fundamentally innovative, morally compelling, and philosophically positive is not what the company's business model actually is, but how the entrepreneur communicates the mission of the company.

The ability to focus and be patient is typically associated not with entrepreneurs but with managers.
Entrepreneurs want results immediately, while managers are happy to wait.

Start-ups are like extreme-skiing runs. The person who wins is the one who screws up the least and doesn't die.

90 percent of Tripod's value was in the amount of press we received in such a concentrated period of time.

The quickest way to completely tank your company is to wholeheartedly believe what you read in the press, especially if it happens to be about you. The vast majority of the press is not interested in covering what is actually happening. They are interested in covering what they think people want to think is actually happening.
