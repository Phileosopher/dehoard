People constantly asking, "What is the best way to do this?" - knowing we'll never discover the best way, but by asking we discover a better way.
Innovation is the "best way" skill. It produces a high level of energy in every company.

Quantification : numbers related to the impact an innovation makes.
Quantify EVERYTHING related to how you do business.
Eventually, you and your people will think of your entire business in terms of the numbers.
Read your business' health chart by the flow of the numbers.
Know which numbers are critical and which aren't.
Become as familiar with your business' numbers as a doctor is with blood pressure / pulse rates.
Without the numbers, you don't know where you are or where you're going.
With the numbers, your business will take on a totally new meaning.

Orchestration is the elimination of discretion or choice at the operating level of your business.
Without orchestration, nothing could be planned or anticipated by you or your customer.
If you're doing everything differently every time you do it, if everyone is doing it at their own discretion, you're creating chaos, not order.
If you haven't orchestrated it, you don't own it.
If you don't own it, you can't depend on it.
Unless your unique way of doing business can be replicated every single time, you don't own it.
Unless your customer gets everything he wants every time, he'll go someplace else to get it.
The business development process is not static - it's not something you do and then are done with - it's something you do all the time.

Innovation, Quantification, Orchestration are the backbone of a business - the Business Development Process.
