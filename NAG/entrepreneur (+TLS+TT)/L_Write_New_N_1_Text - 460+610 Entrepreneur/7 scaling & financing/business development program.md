Identify the following: 

1. Primary Aim
  - Begin living your life as if it were important. Take it seriously. Create it intentionally.
  - What do I value most?
  - What kind of life do I want?
  - What do I want my life to look like, to feel like?
  - How do I wish my day-to-day to be?
  - What would I like to be able to say I truly know in my life, about my life?
  - Who do I wish to be?
  - How would I like to be with other people in my life : my family, friends, business associates, customers, employees?
  - How would I like people to think about me?
  - 2 years from now? 10? 20? End of life?
  - What specifically would I like to learn during my life : spiritually, physically, financially, technically, intellectually, about relationships?

2. Strategic Objective
  - Your strategic objective is a very clear statement of what your business has to ultimately do for you to achieve your primary aim.
  - The first standard is gross revenues. How big will your company be when it's finally done? Know your gross profits, pretax profits, after-tax profits.
  - You can't know all this, but any standards are better than no standards.
  - Does the business I have in mind alleviate a frustration experienced by a large enough group of consumers to make it worth my while?
  - Central demographic model : a most probable customer.

3. Organizational Strategy
  - The organizational development reflected in the Organizational Chart can have a more profound impact on a small company than any other single business development step.
  - More companies organize around personalities rather than around functions. (& the result is chaos)
  - Make a chart of positions : COO, VP Marketing, VP Operations, VP Finance, Sales manager, Advertising/Research manager, Production manager, Service manager, Facilities manager, Accounts receivable manager, Accounts payable manager. (clear tree of who reports to who)
  - A position contract : a summary of the results to be achieved by each position in the company, the work that position is accountable for, a list of standards by which results are to be evaluated. Sign off on it. Not a job description, it is a contract between the company, employee, and a summary of the rules of the game. It provides each person with a sense of commitment and accountability.
  - Look at each position as a franchise prototype of its own.
    - When one goes to work in a position, one goes to work ON a position, implementing the business development process of innovation, quantification, orchestration.
  - Don't hire someone with experience. Not a master technician. A novice, a beginner, an apprentice. Someone eager to learn how to do it right. Willing to learn what you've spent so much time and energy discovering. Someone who is open to the possibility of learning skills not developed yet, skills he/she wants to learn.
  - If you don't obey the rules, honor them, extol them, why should you expect anyone else to take your game seriously?

4. Management Strategy
  - You may think your plan depends on highly skilled people. It doesn't. You don't need such people. You can't afford them. They will become the bane of your existence.
    - What you need is a mangement system.
    - The system will become your management strategy, and produces the results you want.
    - The system will become your solution to the problems of unpredictable people, by orchestrating the process by which management decisions are made, while eliminating the need for such decisions whenever possible.
  - A management system is a system designed into your prototype to produce a marketing result.
    - The more automatic that system is, the more effective your franchise prototype will be.
    - Management development - the process through which you create your management system, and teach up-and-upcoming managers to use it, isn't a management tool - it's a marketing tool.
    - Its purpose is not just to create an efficient prototype but an effective one : one that finds and keeps customers, profitably, better than any other.

5. People Strategy
  - "How do I get my people to do what I want?"
  - You can't get your people to do anything.
  - If you want it done, create an environment where "doing it" is more important to them than not doing it. Where "doing it" well becomes a way of life.
  - The work we do is a reflection of who we are. If we're sloppy at it, it's because we're sloppy inside. If we're late, it's because we're late inside. If we're bored, we're bored inside.
  - The most menial work can be a piece of art when done by an artist.
  - So the job here is not outside of ourselves, but inside of ourselves.
  - Make sure they understand the idea behind the work they're being asked to do. An idea more important than the work itself.
  - Everyone who works here is expected to work towards being the best he can possibly be at the tasks he's accountable for. When he can't do that, he should act like he is. If unwilling to act, leave.
  - A business is like a martial arts practice hall - a dojo - a place you go to practice being the best you can be.
  - A game to be played in which the rules symbolize the idea you, the owner, have about the world.
  - The degree to which they buy into your game doesn't depend on them but on how well you communicate the game to them - at the outset of the relationship - not after it's begun.
  - Your People Strategy is the way you communicate your idea.
    1. Never try to make a game out of what you want your people to do. The game has to come first, what your people do comes second. (?)
    2. Never create a game you're unwilling to play yourself.
    3. Make sure there are ways of winning the game without ending it. (never actually end it, but give occasional victories)
    4. Change the game from time to time : the tactics, not the strategy. (any game can become boring, no matter how extraordinary it was. anticipate the end before anyone else does, and change it by executive action)
    5. Remind people of the game, constantly. Once a week, have a meeting about the game. Once a day, make some kind of issue about an exception to the way the game has been played, and make certain everyone knows about it.
    6. The game has to make sense.
    7. The game needs to be fun from time to time. (not all the time)
    8. If you can't think of a good game, steal one.
  - Hierarchy of systems: (where the "it" is the stated purpose of your business.)
    1 : how we do it here
    2 : how we recruit, hire, and train people to do it here
    3 : how we manage it here
    4 : how we change it here

6. Marketing Strategy
  - When it comes to marketing, what you want is unimportant. It's what your customer wants that matters.
  - What your customer wants is probably different that what he thinks he wants.
  - Make a promise the customer wants to hear, then deliver on that promise better than anyone else on the block.
  - The COO is the driver of all of this. The COO connects each part of the business process. The COO maintains the integrity of the whole.

7. Systems Strategy
  - A system is a set of things, actions, ideas, and information that interact with each other, and in so doing, alter other systems. (?)
  - Information is the glue that holds your system strategy together. It tells you when and why you need to change.
