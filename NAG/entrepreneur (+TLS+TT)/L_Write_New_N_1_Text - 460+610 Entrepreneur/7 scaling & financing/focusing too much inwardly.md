
A company focused on itself - its internal budgets, internal resource concerns, and internal politics - will have a great deal of difficulty with customer-centric thinking.

Spend most of your time outside with customers. Don't spend your time with customers who like you.
Seek out the customers who are the most demanding, the angriest, and the most insightful about tomorrow.
Don't go into these customer dialogues asking yourself, "What do I need to know?"
Ask the right questions, such as: "What am I afraid to find out?"

Customer priorities are the things that are so important to customers that they will pay a premium for them or, when they can't get them, they will switch suppliers.

Decipher what customer priorities are being ignored (a clear link to the words in the left-hand column in Exhibit 2.4).
• Invent a new business design that responds to those priorities.
• Create a new profit zone with extraordinarily high profitability.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO REVISIT THE VOIDS THAT EXIST, INCLUDING WHAT YOUR OWN ORGANIZATION CREATES AS A VOID IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THINGS
