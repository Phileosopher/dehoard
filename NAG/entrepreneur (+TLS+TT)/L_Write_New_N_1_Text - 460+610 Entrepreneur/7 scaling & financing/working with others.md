
OLD tPA: Working With Others
- Never enter a partnership without a buy/sell agreement - no matter how well you know someone, you don't know when he/she will want to retire or leave
- People don't leave companies, they leave management - employees leave if they think they're not being valued or listened to, customers leave if they are dissatisfied with products and services, both reflect on management
- Persuade without power - you can get what you want with force, but instead learn to be kind, passionate, supportive and grateful
- Embrace your fears, and be courageous anyway - you're a bigger man for admitting what scares you, and a great man for following through despite those fears
- Get everyone involved - Incorporate everyone in goal-setting and strategic planning
