## Moelis, Crown Castle

The basic rule is that the board of directors of a company is in charge of the company, and when they are faced with a decision, the directors are supposed to make the choice that they believe is best for the company and all of its shareholders. The shareholders don't make the decision; the board does. 

Now, the directors are elected by the shareholders, and when the company has a controlling shareholder, the idea that the directors are in charge can feel somewhat absurd. The controlling shareholder - say, a founder and chief executive officer who owns 60% of the stock - can come into the boardroom and say "I want you to sell all of the company's assets to me for $1," and the directors will say "no, in our independent judgment that's a bad idea," and the founder/CEO/shareholder will say "okay you're fired," and she will replace them with more pliable directors. And she can do that, because she has the votes.  But still: The directors are supposed to exercise their independent judgment and do what is in the company's best interests, and if they conclude that the founder/CEO's plan is bad, they have to say no and get fired. They can't just say "well, ultimately she controls the company, so we have to do what she asks." Exercising independent judgment is their job.

I cannot promise that every board of directors of every company sees things this way - I think some directors of private startups see their job as "advise and empower the founder/CEO" rather than "exercise independent judgment" - but the courts in Delaware, where most US public companies are incorporated, definitely see things this way. So we [talked recently](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-01-31/elon-musk-is-overpaid) about a Delaware court decision overturning Elon Musk's pay package at Tesla Inc. The basic theory there was that Musk is Tesla's controlling shareholder (even though he owns a minority of the stock), and that the board did not exercise sufficient independent judgment in deciding what to pay him: He asked for a pay package and they deferred to what he wanted. Not okay, said the judge; the board has a duty to make its own independent determination of what he should be paid.

Ken Moelis is the founder, chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of Moelis & Co., the investment bank. In 2014, Moelis & Co. went public, and over time Ken Moelis sold some of his stock. He now owns about 6.5% of the stock, but he has some supervoting shares, which give him about 40.4% of the voting power of the stock. That's not a majority, but it's a lot more than Elon Musk owns of Tesla: Ken Moelis is not necessarily the controlling shareholder of Moelis & Co., but he's at least pretty close.

Beyond his voting stake, though, Ken Moelis has some extra control over his company. Specifically there is a [Stockholders Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1596967/000110465914029215/a14-10912_1ex10d1.htm) that gives Ken Moelis some rights to control the company:

1. He gets to designate a majority of the board of directors: He can name his candidates, and the company's board is obligated to nominate them, recommend that stockholders vote for them, and try to get them elected. (If the shareholders all vote no, his candidates can lose, but with 40.4% of the vote that's pretty unlikely.)
2. His directors also get to serve on all of the board's committees.
3. Ken Moelis has to give his prior approval for a bunch of specified corporate actions, including incurring debt, issuing stock, paying dividends, entering new lines of business, adopting annual budgets and business plans, bringing lawsuits, signing material contracts, removing or appointing executives and changing the company's name.

A shareholder sued, arguing that this is not allowed: Moelis & Co. is a public company incorporated in Delaware, which means that its _board of directors_ has to be in charge of things like hiring and firing the CEO, entering new lines of business or changing its name. A contract can't give its founder the right to make those decisions instead of the board.

And last week a judge - Vice Chancellor Travis Laster of the Delaware Court of Chancery - agreed. [Here is his opinion](https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=360460), which finds that the requirement for Ken Moelis's prior approval of corporate actions is invalid:

> Taken together, the Pre-Approval Requirements  force the Board to obtain Moelis' prior written consent before taking virtually any meaningful action. With the Pre-Approval Requirements in place, the Board is not really a board. The directors only manage the Company to the extent Moelis gives them permission to do so. 

As are most of his rights to name directors: "The Recommendation Requirement improperly compels the Board to recommend Moelis'  
designees for election," even if the board doesn't think those designees are good, and "Determining the composition of committees falls within the Board's authority. A stockholder cannot determine who comprises a committee."

Now, at some level, none of this matters. As a 40% shareholder (by voting rights), and the founder, CEO, chairman of the board and namesake of the firm, Ken Moelis probably _can_ get the board to do most of what he wants, with or without a contract. For one thing, the directors are probably there - on the board of the company he founded and controls - because they think his ideas are mostly good! But also he has a lot of practical control. Moelis & Co. is not going to enter into any new contracts or lines of business without his approval: He's the CEO, he signs the contracts and picks the lines of business. And it's not going to set up any board committees without his approval: He's the chairman of the board, he's in the board meetings, and if the rest of the board votes to set up a committee without him, he does - as the controlling-ish shareholder - probably have the power to vote them out. As long as he gets to nominate directors - even if the board decides not to recommend them - they'll probably get elected, because he has 40% of the vote.

Also, even as a technical matter, there are ways around last week's decision. Vice Chancellor Laster writes:

> Moelis did not have to frame an internal corporate governance arrangement using the Stockholder Agreement. He could have accomplished the vast majority of what he wanted through the Company's certificate of incorporation (the "Charter"). Even now, the Board could implement many of the Challenged Provisions by using its blank check authority to issue Moelis preferred stock carrying a set of voting rights and director appointment rights. A new class of preferred stock need not upset the Company's equity allocation; it could consist of a single golden share. The certificate of designations for the new preferred stock would become part of the Charter as a matter of law. At that point, because the provisions would appear in the Charter, they would comply with Section 141(a). Although some might find it bizarre that the [Delaware General Corporation Law] would prohibit one means of accomplishing a goal while allowing another, that is what the doctrine of independent legal significance contemplates.

A company's charter can give a shareholder a lot of control over its board and business, but an outside agreement can't. 

Still, this decision will have some effects. As Vice Chancellor Laster writes, there are a lot of agreements like this:

> Corporate planners now regularly implement internal governance arrangements through stockholder agreements. The new wave of stockholder agreements does not involve stockholders contracting among themselves to address how they will exercise their stockholder-level rights. The new-wave agreements contain extensive veto rights and other restrictions on corporate action.

And now maybe they are all invalid?

In related news, [Bloomberg's Jef Feeley and Crystal Tse report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/crown-castle-directors-sued-by-co-founder-over-elliott-pact):

> Crown Castle Inc. co-founder Ted Miller ratcheted up a proxy fight with the cellular tower company's board, suing directors over a cooperation agreement they struck with Paul Singer's Elliott Investment Management.
> 
> Miller, who helped launch Crown Castle in 1994, says the board is improperly beholden to activist investor Elliott, one of the company's largest shareholders. Elliott signed a cooperation agreement with Crown Castle in December and got two board seats.
> 
> The agreement amounts to an "unreasonable and disproportionate defensive measure," Miller argues in the suit, filed Tuesday in Delaware Chancery Court. He is asking the court to invalidate the pact, which he says harms Crown Castle shareholders by subjecting them to "the whims of Elliott and the artificial constraints imposed" by the pact on decisions such as finding a new chief executive officer.
> 
> "The affairs of Delaware corporations, however, must be managed by boards of directors, not backroom deals," Miller said in the complaint.

Here is [the complaint](https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rPcwyCbohXPs/v0). What happened here is that Crown Castle is a public company that has had a rough run in recent years, and it attracted _two_ activists: Elliott, a classic activist hedge fund that bought about $2 billion worth of Crown Castle stock, and Miller, the company's founder, who was CEO from 1994 until 2002 and who still owns about $86 million worth of stock. Elliott threatened a proxy contest to get its own nominees on the board of directors, and Crown Castle [quickly settled last December](https://www.sec.gov/ixviewer/ix.html?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1051470/000119312523299402/d761825d8k.htm), agreeing to appoint two Elliott nominees to its board of directors. Elliott and Crown Castle [signed a cooperation agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1051470/000119312523299402/d761825dex101.htm) in which they agreed on some plans, including forming a "fiber review committee" to think about what to do with its fiber business, forming a CEO search committee to find a new CEO, and agreeing to support each other's board nominees. In particular, Crown Castle agreed that, at its 2024 annual meeting, "the Company will recommend that the Company's shareholders vote in favor of the election of each of the Board's nominees," including the two Elliott representatives.

But Miller wants his say too, and he sued, claiming that this agreement gives Elliott power improperly:

> In sum, the Board had struck a grand bargain with Elliott: Elliott would get significant influence over the Company's future direction and strategy - including seats at the table in selecting the next CEO and charting the Company's course on Fiber strategy; in turn, Elliott would lay down its arms, and the incumbent directors would keep their jobs.
> 
> Neither the Company nor Elliott explained why ceding control over key governance decisions to Elliott, a single minority stockholder, while effectively entrenching the incumbent Board, would benefit stockholders.

And in particular, the agreement requires Crown Castle to recommend the Elliott nominees to the board, _even if it gets other, better nominees:_

> In their haste to lock in a deal and establish a frozen board, the Board agreed to the Cooperation Agreement a month before the nomination window for the 2024 Annual Meeting opened and before it had an opportunity to hear timely alternative proposals from any other stockholders. The Director Defendants had a duty to consider stockholder proposals made during the nomination window, which ran from January 18 to February 17, 2024, and to consider each proposal on its merits. The Defendant Directors breached their contractual obligations to stockholders by entering into the preclusive Cooperation Agreement foreclosing such consideration a month before the window opened.

At some level it seems obvious that the board of directors of a company facing a proxy fight might settle with the activist by signing a contract saying "we'll recommend two of your nominees to the board if you support the rest of ours." But is the board _allowed_ to do that? Is it allowed to commit to making a governance decision like that, without considering other possible nominees? Or does that violate the board's obligation to run the company using its own best judgment?
