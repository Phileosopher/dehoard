INFANCY

Unfortunately most business do what the owner wants as opposed to what the business needs.
It's easy to spot a business in infancy : the owner and business are one and the same.
Infancy ends when the owner realizes the business cannot continue to run the way it has been, that to survive it will have to change. This is where most business failures occur.

If your business depends on you, you don't own a business - you have a job. (and you're working for a lunatic)
The purpose of going into business is to get free of a job so you can create jobs for other people.

ADOLESCENCE

Error: Management by abdication ("To relinquish formally a high office or responsibility.") rather than delegation.
The process of deterioration where the number of the balls in the air is not only too much for you, but too much for your people as well.

BEYOND THE COMFORT ZONE

True trust comes from knowing, not from blind faith.
To know, one must understand.
To understand, one must have an intimate awareness of what conditions are truly present. What people know, do, want, are - and what they don't/aren't.
A business that "gets small again" is a business reduced to the level of its owner's personal resistance to change - its owner's comfort zone. (works and waits for something positive to happen)
Businesses that "get small again" die, implode.
Your job is to prepare yourself and your business for growth.
To educate yourself so that, as your business grows, the foundation and structure can carry the additional weight.
** It's up to you to dictate your business's rate of growth by understanding the key processes that need to be performed, the key objectives that need to be achieved, the key position you're aiming for in the marketplace.
Write it down, clearly, so others can understand it. (If you can't, you don't own it!)

MATURITY

Maturity is not an inevitable result of the first two phases. It is not the end of a serial process. Great companies didn't end up as mature companies - they started out that way.
Mature company must also go through infancy and adolescence, but go through them in a different way. It's the perspective that makes the difference.
Very clear picture of what the company would look like when it was done. How it would act.
Unless you act that way from the beginning, you'll never get there. In order to become a great company, act like a great company long before it ever becomes one.
Every day at IBM was a day devoted to business development, not doing business. We didn't do business at IBM, we built one.
The very best businesses are fashioned after a model of a business that works.

How must the business work?
Business as a system for producing outside results - for the customer - resulting in profits.
Picture of a well-defined future, then comes back to the present with the intention of changing it to match the vision.

Survey the world and ask, "Where is the opportunity?"
Identify it, then go back to the drawing board and construct a solution to the frustration found in a group of customers.
Acts the way the customer needs it to act, not the Entrepreneur.
"How will my business look to the customer?" "How will my business stand out from all the rest?"
Within the customer is a continuing parade of changing wants, begging to be satisfied. Find out what those wants are, and what they will be in the future.
