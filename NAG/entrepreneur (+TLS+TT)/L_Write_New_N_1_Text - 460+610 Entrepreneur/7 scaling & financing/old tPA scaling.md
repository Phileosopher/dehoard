
### Scale the company as the work increases

Re-invest every dollar possible
- The more money you put back into the business, the more it can grow

Avoid overpaying taxes
- Track every receipt and have a reputable accountant review your information

Ignore competitors' financial statements
- Try to use your resources better instead of how much money others invested

Slowly scale the company
- Adding markets too quickly leaves the company unprepared to take on new challenges
- Expanding too rapidly stretches resources too thin to recover from an unexpected event
- Slowly scaling takes both patience and flexibility
- Practices gradually harden into company policy as it grows and requires micromanagement to avoid bureaucracy

Outsource work when it becomes cost-effective
- A full-time worker is unprofitable at first, so hire consultants and part-time workers
- Research automated solutions with tools like [Cloudwards](https://www.cloudwards.net/) and [PC Magazine](https://www.pcmag.com) reviews

Never split large-scale goals
- Pursue one venture at a time and build the business up, then transition to another as you free up responsibilities

Stay focused on the big picture as you perform each task
- Some of the most important tasks don't scale with a company
- Each worker, especially the owner, will progressively work more at niche-focused core abilities

Your growing business will allow you to do more of what you excel at and less of everything else
- A company reaches its limit when the owner is overworked in tasks outside their expertise

A company's ability to adapt and change will slow down as it grows

- More people create more thoughts, which complicate projects
- Try restructuring the business or making it small again
- If the company grows past a certain size or trajectory, sell the company if you feel like it
    - Many entrepreneurs love the thrill of creating a business from nothing so much they make a living selling companies they built

Most entrepreneurial skills don't change as the organization scales, so always act like a startup
Leadership skills are the only limit to the size of a business

If you're self-employed or run a business, it's vital to separate your professional and personal lives
