
Figure out your profit moment
- This is when you will make a profit instead of a loss for that month
- Find out how much time until the money runs out to see how much "fudge room" you have
- You want to get to this point as fast as possible, or you have ZERO security that your business will stay open
- While you may think you can raise money later after the first round, it won't go that easily later because the investors will have lost [faith] in you
- What bites them the second time is a confluence of three forces:
    - The company is spending more now than it did the first time it raised money.
    - Investors have much higher standards for companies that have already raised money.
    - The company is now starting to read as a failure. The first time it raised money, it was neither a success nor a failure; it was too early to ask. Now it's possible to ask that question, and the default answer is failure, because at this point that is the default outcome.

Venture capitalist Randy Komisar, whose book "Getting to Plan B" discussed the concept of leaps of faith in great detail, uses a framework of "analogs" and "antilogs" to plot strategy.

What differentiates the success stories from the failures is that the successful entrepreneurs had the foresight, the ability, and the tools to discover which parts of their plans were working brilliantly and which were misguided, and adapt their strategies accordingly.

Genchi gembutsu, which is one of the most important phrases in the lean manufacturing vocabulary. In English, it is usually translated as a directive to "go and see for yourself" so that business decisions can be based on deep firsthand knowledge.

You cannot be sure you really understand any part of any business problem unless you go and see for yourself firsthand. It is unacceptable to take anything for granted or to rely on the reports of others.

Craft a customer archetype, a brief document that seeks to humanize the proposed target customer. This archetype is an essential guide for product development and ensures that the daily prioritization decisions that every product team must make are aligned with the customer to whom the company aims to appeal.

A minimum viable product (MVP) is simply the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort.

The goal of the MVP is to begin the process of learning,

Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses.

Most entrepreneurs and product development people dramatically overestimate how many features are needed in an MVP. When in doubt, simplify.

Most entrepreneurs approach a question like this by building the product and then checking to see how customers react to it. I consider this to be exactly backward because it can lead to a lot of waste. First, if it turns out that we're building something nobody wants, the whole exercise will be an avoidable expense of time and money. If customers won't sign up for the free trial, they'll never get to experience the amazing features that await them. Even if they do sign up, there are many other opportunities for waste. For example, how many features do we really need to include to appeal to early adopters? Every extra feature is a form of waste, and if we delay the test for these extra features, it comes with a tremendous potential cost in terms of learning and cycle time. The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time.

Always focused on scaling something that was working rather than trying to invent something that might work in the future.

Contrast this with the case of a small business, in which it is routine to see the CEO, founder, president, and owner serving customers directly, one at a time. In a concierge MVP, this personalized service is not the product but a learning activity designed to test the leap-of-faith assumptions in the company's growth model.

As you consider building your own minimum viable product, let this simple rule suffice: remove any feature, process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek.

The most common objection I have heard over the years to building an MVP is fear of competitors - especially large established companies - stealing a startup's ideas.

MVP can seem like a dangerous branding risk. Easy solution: launch the MVP under a different brand name. Experiment under the radar and then do a public marketing launch once the product has proved itself with real customers.

Prepare for the fact that MVPs often result in bad news.

The solution to this dilemma is a commitment to iteration. You have to commit to a locked-in agreement - ahead of time - that no matter what comes of testing the MVP, you will not give up hope.

Innovation accounting works in three steps:
(1) Use a minimum viable product to establish real data on where the company is right now.
(2) Startups must attempt to tune the engine from the baseline toward the ideal. This may take many attempts. After the startup has made all the micro changes and product optimizations it can to move its baseline toward the ideal, the company reaches a decision point. That is the third step:
(3) Pivot or persevere. If the company is making good progress toward the ideal, that means it's learning appropriately and using that learning effectively, in which case it makes sense to continue. If not, the management team eventually must conclude that its current product strategy is flawed and needs a serious change. When a company pivots, it starts the process all over again, reestablishing a new baseline and then tuning the engine from there. The sign of a successful pivot is that these engine-tuning activities are more productive after the pivot than before.

Smoke test with its marketing materials. This is an old direct marketing technique in which customers are given the opportunity to preorder a product that has not yet been built. A smoke test measures only one thing: whether customers are interested in trying a product. By itself, this is insufficient to validate an entire growth model. Nonetheless, it can be very useful to get feedback on this assumption.

These MVPs provide the first example of a learning milestone.

Remember that the rationale for building low-quality MVPs is that developing any features beyond what early adopters require is a form of waste. However, the logic of this takes you only so far. Once you have found success with early adopters, you want to sell to mainstream customers. Mainstream customers have different requirements and are much more demanding. The kind of pivot we needed is called a customer segment pivot. In this pivot, the company realizes that the product it's building solves a real problem for real customers but that they are not the customers it originally planned to serve. In other words, the product hypothesis is confirmed only partially.

All the work that goes into designing the minimum viable product is - until the moment that product is shipped - just WIP inventory. Incomplete designs, not-yet-validated assumptions, and most business plans are WIP.

Almost every Lean Startup technique we've discussed so far works its magic in two ways: by converting push methods to pull and reducing batch size. Both have the net effect of reducing WIP.
