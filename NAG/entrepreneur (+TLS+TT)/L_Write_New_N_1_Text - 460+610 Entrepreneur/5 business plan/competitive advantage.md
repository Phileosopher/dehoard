
There are really only three sustainable competitive advantages:
1. Supply. A company has this edge when it controls an important resource: A company may have a proprietary technology that is protected by a patent.
2. Demand. A company can control a market because customers are loyal to it, either out of habit - to a brand name, for example - or because the cost of switching to a different product is too high.
3. Economies of scale. If your operating costs remain fixed while output increases, you can gain a significant edge because you can offer your product at lower cost without sacrificing profit margins.
    Having a superior competitive advantage of handsome retained earnings, a fine business selling in the market place for less than intrinsic value, should repurchase its shares at this lower market price.

One question I always ask myself in appraising a business is how I would like, assuming I had ample capital and skilled personnel, to compete with it.

Say bread ingredients cost $1.95.
The baker who charges $2 a loaf has to sell twenty-one loaves for every loaf the luxury baker sells at $3.
Twenty-one times as many is the difference between a few customers an hour or a line out the door.
"But our customers would prefer to pay the lower price."?
Perhaps. But how do they value the sparkling clean shop, with plenty of well-paid and helpful staff, a new sign in the window, and a local baseball team with new jerseys with your logo on them? How do they value the handsome shopping bag that comes with every loaf, not to mention the free samples of the little butter cookies you call punitions?
How does it make them feel to tell their friends that they're eating the same bread that's served at the fancy restaurant down the street?
Better to apologize for the price once than to have to excuse a hundred small slights again and again.
- this is only true SOMETIMES
- other times, you want the product at scale, meaning you don't really care about a high-quality image
- the advantage in THAT situation is that they tell their friends that it's the cheapest bread in town

- indicate how its business model is NOT driven by profit, and that "goodwill" or "charity" is a great way to get public attention on it
- it's the reason why groups like Airbnb, Uber, and others can signal "woke" and get away with terrible actions
- Signaling, however, works because it dupes people into thinking you care about the community
