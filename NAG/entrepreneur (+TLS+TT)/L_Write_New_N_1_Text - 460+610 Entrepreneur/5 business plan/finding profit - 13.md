
The number one problem in business today is profitability.
Where will you be allowed to make a profit in your industry?
Where is the profit zone today? Where will it be tomorrow?
The profit zone is the area of your economic neighborhood where you are allowed to earn a profit.
To reach and operate in the profit zone is the goal of every company.

Am I managing for market share, or for profit?
Is the market share I own profitable and alive, or is it profitless and dead?

Fast-growing industries such as PC manufacturing, consumer electronics, telecommunications, and software have each produced scores of terminally unprofitable companies.
By contrast, no-growth or low-growth industries have produced some of the most successful companies in the world.
Coca-Cola achieved significant value growth in the low-growth beverage industry, as did General Electric (GE) in a collection of low-growth manufacturing industries, and Swatch in the low-growth watchmaking industry.

Contenders to match price reductions or lose customers to a lower-priced competitor. It creates no-profit zones.

No-profit zones come in various forms.
- value chain (distribution in computing or the grocery segment in carbonated beverages)
- individual customers (Wal-Mart or other large, powerful buyers)
- entire business models (hub-and-spoke airlines)

Start with the profit question ("Where will I be allowed to make a profit?") and work your way back.
1. What's most important to the customer?
2. Where can we make a profit?
3. How can we gain market share in that space?

If the business is to succeed, it must be designed in such a way that its key elements are aligned with customers' most important priorities. It must be designed for profitability.

A more extensive repertoire of value capture mechanisms than they ever have before: financing, ancillary products, solutions, downstream participation in the value chain, value sharing, licensing,

Which customers I choose depends on which customers will allow me to make a profit.

IBM, GM, Sears, Kodak, US Steel, United Airlines. The actual list is quite long. Market share leaders? Yes. Profitable? No.

In value migration, customers move from A to B, and the profit zone moves from A to B with them.
The incumbent stays at A. The newcomer builds a business design to go to B.

This value shift has occurred often:
from IBM to Microsoft and Intel
USX to Nucor
United Airlines to Southwest Air
Computer-vision to Parametric Technology
Folgers to Starbuck's
Kmart to Wal-Mart.
