
Choose a few consumers that you really feel are the early adopters, test
it with them, see what they like about it and what they don't like about
it â€¦ And, if it appeals to them, use them to optimize it [the idea]
further and then the laggards will follow.

always consider the customers' desires
- Customers pay the entire organization
- Consistency is often more valuable than quality
- Customers care about fast and reliable results more than distributors, vendors, sellers or anyone else
- Customers choose an expert because they appear to be more valuable than the competition
