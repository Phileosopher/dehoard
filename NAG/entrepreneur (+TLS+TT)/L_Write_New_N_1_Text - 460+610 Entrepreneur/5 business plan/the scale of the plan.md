
If you can start small, do it
- Because of technology, startups in many industries are extremely affordable to begin, sometimes only the cost of food and rent!

Achievable: take 10% of your forecast, make this your goal, and blow it away.

Postpone touchy-feely goals. Companies that reach on measurable goals are happy.

Marvin Minsky:
Pick a big enough project, something that's really hard, something that over the years you can work on.
