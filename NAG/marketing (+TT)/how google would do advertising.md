
Marketers' ultimate goal should be to eliminate advertising by improving their products and relationships instead. (This is an unreachable Nirvana, but a good goal.)

Google - and Apple - make money by giving a key part of their business away for free, then making money on something else.

Too often, companies think that everything they do has value they must capture, charge for, monetize, preserve, restrict, and protect. Instead, the real value may come from the side.

Invest effort in social tools that enable customers to tell you what you should be producing. Hand over as much control to them as you can.

Advertising is supposed to tell us about a product or its price so we can save effort, time, and money in our search for it. Doesn't the internet itself replace advertising? Often, yes.

The fundamental message of marketing must change from "we want your money" to "we share your interests".

Companies should buy ads on relevant blogs, as a way to underwrite blogs, as they would a PBS show. Share the interests and affections of the blog's readers.
