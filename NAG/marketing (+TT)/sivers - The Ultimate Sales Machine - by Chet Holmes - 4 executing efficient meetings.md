
Constant attention to the 3 Ps : Planning, Procedures, and Policies
Hold regular, highly productive, workshop-style meetings dedicated to improving every aspect of your business.
In each of these meetings, focus all of the relevant people on fixing just one small part of the business.
Together, brainstorm plans for how to improve this specific area, draft procedures to test, and ultimately create carved-in-stone company policies that everyone will be trained to follow.

Have systems in place that would make hiring 50 people every week a breeze.
This makes the difference between success and failure.
A company that thinks like a small company remains small.
A company, even a one-person army, that thinks and acts like a big company is going to grow faster, smarter, and better.
"What if I were hiring 50 people next week and I wanted all of them to enter the business and quickly be able to perform at peak levels? What kind of a training program do I need in place to do that?"
