
People who are eager to please, always looking for more to do, always wanting more responsibility, always wanting to know more than you think they need to know. They're worth every penny if you properly channel their energy.

List 3 initiatives that you'd love to hire someone to execute in which the reward could be great if the person did an excellent job for you.
Write down what it would mean to have a superstar in that position. Write down what you could afford to pay them if they performed.
Based on that, put an ad in the paper using the highest possible figure as bait.
Write down the personality profile you think would make someone succeed in that job.
DISC personality profile : Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Compliance.
Ad : "Superstars only. $50k to $300k. Don't even call unless you are an overachiever and can prove it. Come build an empire within our company."
Background is not relevant. Someone "has the stuff" or doesn't. (?)
INTERVIEWING: (NOTE: THIS IS MOSTLY AIMED AT FINDING SALES PEOPLE!)
First thing you do is reject them. You're looking for the unique personality profile that becomes more effective in the face of adversity.
A superstar will start to question your reasoning - and may even tell you that you're wrong.
Prescreening call : Say, "The ad said don't even apply unless you think you're the best. So why should we interview you?"
You can do this even before telling them what the job is. Test their ego.
Once they start talking, say, "I'm not really hearing superstar. I'm not hearing top producer."
The good ones should disagree, and tell you why they are.
The idea candidates will try to qualify you just as they would a prospective client!

Step 1 : Relax
Ask them to write down 5 questions you want to be asked in the interview, that will show your best side.

Step 2 : Probe
Explain that your company hires based on personality profile rather than background and ask them directly, "Do you agree this is more pertinent?"
When they say yes, say that you'd like to find out what shaped them, and start with their childhood. Get OK first.
Probing childhood is essential because self-confidence is shaped early in life.

* Background:
"What events or influences from your childhood shaped who you are today?"
"What are some of the biggest challenges in your life? They need not be work-related."
"What was the toughest sale you ever made?"

* Areas of accomplishment - how much of an overachiever in any area:
"Tell me about a time in your life when the odds were stacked against you, but you overcame them and succeeded."
"Tell me 3 or 4 things of which you are most proud."
"Have you ever practiced and reached a high level in any area beyond just getting by in life?"

* Empathy and ability to bond with others:
"How would your best friend describe you?"
"Of everyone you know, who has the most faith in you? Why?"
"What are your best memories?"
(look for long answers who try to win you over with tales of their past)

* Ask candidates to rate themselves on a scale of 1 to 10 in these areas:
Ambition
Confidence
Ability to face rejection
Establishing rapport
Qualifying skills
Ablity to create desire in others
Closing skills
Time management
Presentation skills
Strategic thinking
Market knowledge
Self-improvement
Getting around gatekeepers
(top producers will rate themselves high in all areas, but so will dreamers who are trying to hide insecurity.)

* How do they measure themselves against the best of the best?
"Who is the best salesperson you've ever met?"
If they say themselves, they're hired. If they say someone else, ask what differentiates them from the person they named.

* How dedicated are they to self-improvement?
Ask what the last self-help book they read

* Go through their résumé:
Why did you leave your last job?
Were you unhappy? Why?
Tell me about a disappointment or disagreement you've had with a boss and what happened.
Name two weak points of previous bosses.
Name two instances when a supervisor criticized you.
(Don't react negatively to anything they say, or they'll shut down.)

Step 3 : Attack
Say thank you this is all wonderful, but I don't really get the impression you're a superstar.
Be tactful, but not soft, when looking for salespeople. Don't say something weak like, "You haven't convinced me yet."
Superstars never crumble. They have tremendous faith in themselves.
They have to really believe you think they don't have the stuff.
Make all candidates sell themselves at least a little for every position.

As long as you're willing to pay, even just on performance, you might be shocked to find there's someone perfect who will build your company for you as long as you share the wealth as they do so.

The key to keeping superstars is never say no to them. Instead, redirect their energy or give them a few hurdles to jump in order to get what they want.

The more you challenge superstars, the more you encourage them to overachieve. But don't forget to compliment them when they meet and exceed your challenge.
