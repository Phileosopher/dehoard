
Mastery is a direct result of pigheaded discipline and determination.

Becoming a master of karate was not about learning 4000 moves, but about doing just a handful of moves 4000 times.

Market data can motivate purchasing when people might not even feel they need the product.

Here an entire side business has been born : selling telephone follow-up to dealerships that can't figure how to properly manage that practice internally.

Don't dictate what the follow-up should be. That is a mistake most executives make. Have meetings where these things are discussed and developed. Have great follow-up procedures, but the folks in the trenches can help develop them. They will buy in much better to procedures that they themselves helped to create.

A typical problem : The CEO believes he has to think of all the solutions to every problem.

If you have a good staff, the only thing you need to bring to a meeting is your judgement.

Work together on a problem, developing the ideas and insights to propel the company forward.

The ideas you generate as a group are light-years ahead of what any one of you, including the CEO, would have created on your own.

Ask every person to give 3 examples of how to improve some aspect of the company or department.
The group will work together and each person will be listened to with respect.

Once you have a list of things you need to work on to improve your business,
each one of those items needs its own workshop to solve the problems or remove the obstacles.

Post-workshop memo says new procedure developed as result of meeting. ("Here are 9 things you can do when a customer is unhappy.")
That goes into a procedure book that becomes a training manual for all new people.
Save the dailies, too, and at the end of the year you will have 50-100 pages that document a year's worth of workshops.

Develop a hierarchy of solutions the customer service reps could offer to keep a customer happy. Each rep is authorized to offer a solution. If the customer is still unhappy, the rep can offer another solution. If customer is still unhappy, a 3rd solution. Only then if all those fail does the rep need to get a supervisor involved.

Great workshop question : What is something else you can offer the buyer at the point of sale?
One out of 3 people will buy something else if offered at the point of sale.

Have participants in the group write down every single idea that comes to them. Give everyone a few minutes to work on this. Don't let them call out ideas. Leader must participate as well. 2 minutes should be enough.

Vote on which ideas would work best. People's opinions change as collective intelligence of group is shared. Get consensus. Look at all, then rank #1-3.

TEN STEPS TO IMPLEMENT ANY NEW POLICY:
1. Get everyone to feel the pain
2. Hold a workshop to generate solutions
3. Develop a conceptual solution or procedure
4. Leader personally performs procedure or task
5. Set a deadline for testing the conceptual procedure
6. Document step-by-step procedure or process
7. Have show-and-tell role playing
8. Have another workshop on how to improve
9. Monitor the procedure directly
10. Measure and reward the outcome

"What if it took a little extra work in the beginning to gain this learning curve, but once you had it, would dramatically reduce many if not all of these challenges?"

People respect what you inspect.
Rewarding comes last.
Set very specific criteria for rewarding your team.
Make a big deal out of the reward process.
People work even harder for recognition than money.
