Let's not have people making up what they're going to do in a crisis or in any other situation in your company or department. Have them know what to do in every situation because you address it weekly.

Constantly teach the same information again and again until the skill is permanent.

To begin a training session, people should be told what to expect:
* - What will be covered
* - How long it will take
* - How the information will be covered
* - The objective of the particular session
* - The obtained skill or knowledge you hope they will gain

When people have a clear understanding of what they are about to hear and see, they will be mentally prepared and focused for the training.
It's important to create a training environment that is conducive to learning. Make it fun!
People should look forward to it because they know it will be interesting and stimulating.

- Workshop Training

Do ongoing and continuing technology training, so that all employees know how to use the technology they have in the fastest most efficient way possible.

What's your training plan?
What kind of training are you going to provide?
Who? Which departments or people need what kind of training?
Why? What's the impact going to be?
When are you going to conduct the training?
How? What methods will you use and why are they best for the material you'll cover?

Developing a regular and consistent training program will enable you to effectively and systematically accomplish the following:
- Train new employees who can hit the ground running
- Upgrade knowledge and skills of existing employees so that everything they do works better, smarter, faster
- Provide continuous professional development so your staff becomes more and more effective
- Solve any and all problems that come up in your organization
