
No one should have more than six direct reports.

Be an absolute expert in managing your own time and have the systems in place to make sure that everyone in your organization is skilled in time management as well.

Break the company down into (9) "impact areas" and hold weekly one-hour meetings in each area. An impact area is any part of your company that has a direct impact on the bottom line. Your impact areas may include sales, customer service, project development, marketing, for example. In order to improve and perfect each of these areas you need to give them a dedicated one hour per week when everyone involved can focus exclusively on improving that area.

To-dos, tasks, and deadlines must be assigned after every meeting, but don't ask for too much to be completed.

Police these six simple steps throughout your entire staff:
#1 : Touch it once
If you touch it, take action. Don't open that email or letter until you're ready to deal with it.
#2 : Make lists
List the 6 most important things you need to do, and get those things completed each day.
#3 : Plan how much time you will allocate to each task
If one or more of the items on your list is too big to accomplish in one day, then write down how much time during that day you will dedicate to it.
What important initiatives are you just not getting to because they take too much time? Do them in small chunks of time.
#4 : Plan the day
Write out an hour-by-hour schedule, and stick to it.
#5 : Prioritize
Put the most important task first
Get your people productive by examining how they're prioritizing and planning their day, every day.
#6 : Ask "Will it hurt me to throw this away?"
80% of all filed or stored information is never referred to again. So why hold on to it?

When something interferes with your schedule, deal with it and then go back to your schedule!
