
The purpose of buyer education is to create brand loyalty : a large and loyal following of customers who automatically come there first.

People will pay more if they perceive there is a greater value or deeper reason for buying from one provider over another.

If most of your buyers are not experts at what to look for in your product or service, this opens a gaping strategic opportunity for the brilliant strategist to capitalize on.

Every buyer can be taught how to be a better buyer of your type of product or service.

Who is the ideal person in your audience? Who is in your stadium, for your stadium pitch?
If you say, "I'm here to tell you why we have the greatest office equipment in the world", you're going to have 90% of the audience leave.
Re-think the stadium title.

This approach of offering some education of value to them gives you a significant opportunity to attract more buyers and build more credibility.

You will attract way more buyers if you are offering to teach them something of value to them, than by trying to sell them your product or service.

Offering an education that helps the buyer is giong to get more buyer interest.

If the information is actually good and useful, it automatically repositions you in the mind of the buyer as much more of an expert than your competitors. You're teaching them things about their own business that they might not know.

If you think and plan strategically, you will find a way to weave that information in such a way that ultimately sells your service far better than you could ever sell by simply flat-out pitching your product.

When you sell, you break rapport. When you educate, you build it.

Train every single salesperson with a massive amount of information.

Data makes your information work harder. The more complex your product or service, the better the opportunity to appear as an expert.

Your competitors will be more concerned about selling product than about positioning themselves as experts.

List your strategic objectives. For each, what would make you more respected? What would position you as an expert in the eye of the buyer?
Keep track of everything you find (in the news, etc) that could be of value to your customers.
