Mark has never sold accounts one by one. Looked instead for influencers: people with their own large networks who, if sold on his idea, venture, or opportunity, could potentially generate entire volumes of transactions for him.

"I lose one out of five for being too aggressive." She paused for effect, then added, "But I get the other four!"
