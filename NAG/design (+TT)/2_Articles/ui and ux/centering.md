Easy way to make your text look balanced

Previously, I remember there were libraries calculating that stuff, for example, [React Wrap Balancer](https://react-wrap-balancer.vercel.app/).

But now, it's possible to do with pure CSS.
​
It's probably been around for years, but I learned about it a year ago.
​
Two options that save my life:

text-wrap: balance and text-wrap: pretty.
​
The first one makes your text balanced (not too lengthy, not too short, sustaining optimal line length).

The second ensures you don't have orphans (single words at the end of a line).
