open houses will NOT sell a house so much, and it's better to sell by marketing yourself or using Zillow/Redfin/Realtor.com
- a good realtor does other things, but that open house is the REALTOR'S lead generation

when the market is dropping, it's wisest to hold until the market goes up again
- the renter market goes down as well (since many renters become buyers of other houses), so it's hard to do anything with a property in a dropping market
- lower-priced houses swing hardest
