## Banks are where the money isn’t

I don’t know, man, it’s all very simple. Here’s what a mortgage is:

1. A company gives me $100,000 to buy a house.
2. I pay the company back $665 per month for 30 years. [[3]](imap://dave%40stucky%2Etech@mail.stucky.tech:993/fetch%3EUID%3E.INBOX%3E7174#footnote-3)

And here is what an annuity is:

1. You give a company $100,000.
2. The company pays you back $665 per month for the next 30 years.

I mean, _probably_ the annuity is more like “the company pays you back $665 per month for the rest of your life, which it actuarially expects to be 30 years,” but it _could_ be a fixed term. The point is that these trades are _pretty_ similar. They both involve a large upfront payment, followed by fixed amortizing payments over an expected term of decades. [[4]](imap://dave%40stucky%2Etech@mail.stucky.tech:993/fetch%3EUID%3E.INBOX%3E7174#footnote-4) In the right circumstances, we could cut out the middlemen — you could just give me your $100,000, and I could pay you back over 30 years — but that would require a lot of work.

Here is what a bank account is:

1. You give a bank some money.
2. The bank pays you a little interest each month, and lets you take out your money (or put more back in) at any time.

Just a different trade. Nothing wrong with it, but different.

On first principles, if you were trying to set up a financial system, which of these things would you pair with each other? Like: There are people who need to borrow money to buy houses. They’ll need the money for decades, and they’ll make monthly payments to amortize the loans. And there are people who need to fund their retirement, who’ll sock away a lot of money at the start of retirement so they can get monthly payments for decades. And then there are some other people who need access to liquid cash, so they’ll put away some money that they might need at any moment. Which source of money — the people who need to put away money for decades in exchange for fixed payments, or the people who need to put away money to pay rent next week — should provide the funding for the people who need loans?

Historically the answer is “the people who need their money next week fund the 30-year mortgages”: The banking system matches short-term savers with long-term borrowers, funding itself with demand deposits and using those deposits to make mortgages. This system [has some big benefits](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/36079366.223888/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMtMDMtMTcvYmlnLWJhbmtzLXRydXN0LWZpcnN0LXJlcHVibGljLXdpdGgtdGhlaXItbW9uZXk_Y21waWQ9QkJEMDcxNjI0X01PTkVZU1RVRkYmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX3Rlcm09MjQwNzE2JnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1tb25leXN0dWZm/60e87ce39a995a4b1a2deb96B72c720f9) in terms of spurring economic activity, but it also has extremely well-known problems: _It’s a Wonderful Life_, “[the money’s not here, well your money’s in Joe’s house](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/36079366.223888/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1pUGtKSDZCVDdkTQ/60e87ce39a995a4b1a2deb96Bf0521134),” etc. Much of modern banking regulation is about tempering those problems, at the cost of restricting the activity.

All very tidy.

> Yield-hungry insurance firms are adopting an unconventional strategy: they’re skipping mortgage-backed bonds and buying the underlying whole loans outright.
> 
> It’s a trend that’s picked up pace over the last few years. Last year alone, insurers increased their holdings of residential mortgage loans by a whopping 45%, or about $20 billion, according to an analysis by Ellington Management Group.
> 
> The loans typically don’t qualify for being bundled into bonds supported by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac — government-backed companies that guarantee most US mortgages for investors. The borrowers are usually riskier, and investors owning mortgages directly, rather than slices of mortgage-backed bonds, means firms have to deal with arduous tasks often left to specialists. Not every firm has the size or sophistication to do that, which is why large alternative asset managers like Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co. are leading the shift.
> 
> So why bother with the hassle of owning these loans directly, rather than in securitized form? Better yields. It’s difficult to quantify exactly, but insurers with the capability to own mortgages directly could save some 35-45 basis points on the cost of securitization itself, and that’s without considering the substantial amount of capital freed up on insurance company balance sheets because of the better risk treatment, according to Ryan Singer, head of global residential investments at Balbec Capital. …
> 
> Helping drive the shift is a combination of favorable industry risk rules and an influx of cash from annuities. Under insurance rules overseen by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, whole loans get similar treatment as A rated corporate bonds but yield more. What’s more, a pool of mortgages in their whole loan form gets better risk treatment on insurers’ balance sheets than that same pool of mortgages when held in the form of a bond, said Dupont. 
> 
> Insurers have also taken in enormous amounts of cash recently from people buying annuities. Insurers sold $385 billion in annuities last year, a more than 75% increase from 2020, according to data from Limra. Putting that cash to work in whole loans is appealing, said Bayview’s Mueller Handal, as the average life of most annuities sold today generally fits the average life of the residential loans — five or more years, roughly. 

So much of the apparatus of modern finance — all this securitization — is weirdly historically contingent. Why shouldn’t giant asset managers with long-term locked-up funding also be in the business of making the loans?



[3] That is, 7% annual interest on the $100,000, plus principal payments to amortize the loan over the 30 years.

[4] Also both sometimes terminate early, but there are some actuarially predictable prepayment expectations.
