> "It's been disappointing for a long time," said Eileen Neill, managing director at Verus Investments, an adviser to New Mexico's roughly $17 billion public employee pension, which axed its risk-parity allocation in December. "The only time risk parity was really successful was at the time of the Great Financial Crisis and that was really its heyday."

> The lackluster run through the post-pandemic booms and busts has rattled faith in an allocation method pioneered by [Ray] Dalio, who built Bridgewater into the world's largest hedge fund. The strategy focuses on diversification across assets based on how volatile each is, and often uses leverage to optimize returns relative to the risks taken.

> It flourished after the 2008 financial crisis as investors sought a way to protect themselves from the next big cataclysm. But as investors went on to plow back into stocks, they lagged in the up years. Then when markets cracked in 2022 — pummeling safe assets like US Treasuries — they were hit even harder.

Intuitively [the way risk parity works](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35121691.264812/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvUmlza19wYXJpdHk/60e87ce39a995a4b1a2deb96B5168851c) is that you invest some of your portfolio in stocks and some of it in bonds, with the goal that each part contributes the same amount of volatility to the portfolio. So if stocks have 30% volatility and bonds have 10% volatility, you put three-quarters of your money in bonds and one quarter in stocks, crudely speaking. The more volatile an asset has been, the less money you allocate to it. When bonds have been very stable for a long period, you put a lot of your money in bonds. When stocks then go up a lot for years, you underperform a more-stock-weighted portfolio. When interest rates suddenly go up a lot — and bonds crash before you update your historical volatility measures — you lose money.
