1. Interest rates were very low for a very long time.
2. Now they are higher.
3. People just forgot that that was a possibility, and were surprised.

There are various important manifestations of this — a frozen US housing market, the 2023 regional banking crisis — but it is pervasive in strange small ways too. For instance, for a long time, the way that debt investing worked was​​​ that you bought some bonds, and their prices went up or down, and you had inflows or outflows, so you had various reasons to sell the bonds you had or buy new bonds. If you asked “what drives demand for bonds,” you’d get answers about client inflows or relative value or whatever. But in 2024 you get [stories like this](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35934584.221901/aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmJsb29tYmVyZ2xhdy5jb20vY2FwaXRhbC1tYXJrZXRzL2NvcnBvcmF0ZS1hbWVyaWNhcy1pbnRlcmVzdC1wYXltZW50cy1hcmUtZnVlbGluZy1hLW1hcmtldC1yYWxseQ/60e87ce39a995a4b1a2deb96Bf047f39b):

> Investors’ rising income from their corporate bond holdings is giving them more money to buy corporate bonds now. The total income generated by the high-grade corporate credit market should be around $369 billion this year, or 15% more than last year, according to an analysisby Bank of America Corp. strategists.

> The imbalance between coupon payments to be reinvested and bonds expected to be sold could help keep valuations for corporate bonds relatively strong, said Travis King, head of US investment-grade corporates at Voya Investment Management.

Banks have also been piling into the AAA bonds, and some Japanese institutions may scoop up more of the debt. On top of that, Bank of America estimates that about $64 billion of the debt has been paid back so far this year, including amortizations and called CLOs, meaning asset owners have more capital to put to work.

It turns out that, if you are a bond investor, you buy bonds, and then those bonds _pay you interest_, and then if you want to keep being a bond investor you might use that interest to buy more bonds. Just not a problem people had in 2020!
