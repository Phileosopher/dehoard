A story that I would have told about private equity is that, in the olden days, a private equity fund was a couple of youngish ex-bankers who put up their own money and raised some money from outside investors to do leveraged buyouts of companies with very small equity checks, a novel and risky model in which all the participants — the fund's founders, their outside investors, the lenders — were consciously taking big risks in the swashbucklier corners of the financial markets. And now, decades later, those private equity firms have become gigantic alternative asset managers that run hundreds of billions of dollars for insurance companies, with thousands of employees and much steadier and more diversified returns. Everything has become domesticated and institutionalized. You don't invest with a private equity firm, these days, because you like the fire in the eyes of its 30-year-old founder; you invest because of its giant platform and suite of products and long track record.

Still you want a little fire in the eyes. Bloomberg's [Laura Benitez and Swetha Gopinath report](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35081496.281811/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjQtMDQtMTgvcHJpdmF0ZS1lcXVpdHktaW52ZXN0b3JzLWRyaXZpbmctdG91Z2hlci1kZWFscy1hcy1wb3dlci1iYWxhbmNlLXNoaWZ0cz9jbXBpZD1CQkQwNDE4MjRfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yNDA0MTgmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/60e87ce39a995a4b1a2deb96B9d8cf01b):

> The biggest backers of buyout firms are wielding their ever-growing bargaining power to drive increasingly tough deals. The latest in a string of investor demands is this: If you want our money, put more of yours in first. As a result, some private equity executives — at both big and small firms — are loading up on more debt and pledging personal assets to appease them. This includes their homes and other valuables as well as traditional collateral such as fees and stakes in other funds.
> 
> The equity contributions from buyout firms into new funds has jumped to an average of 5% from 2% last year, and in some cases as much as 20%, according to people familiar with the matter. It's leaving some managers scrambling to find significant amounts of capital in often short time frames, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private agreements.

> To raise cash, some are taking out high-interest loans that can charge rates into the mid-to-high teens, and are often backed by holiday homes, cars, second businesses and art collections, the people said. Some banks are demanding that executives pledge the bulk, if not all of their personal assets, some of the people said.

"We are not going to invest in your private equity fund unless you'd lose your house if you mess up" just seems like more of a 1970s ask than a 2020s one, but I like it. Meanwhile of course the giant alternative asset managers are also in the business of lending each other money to invest in their funds:

> Investec Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are among banks providing such loans, according to people familiar with the matter. The industry's need for more capital has also given rise to several private credit lenders such as Ares Management, Oaktree Capital Management's 17Capital and Pemberton Asset Management, who have raised, or are raising funds to lend out.

So:

1. Do you think that the Ares and Oaktree professionals need to put a lot of their personal assets into those lending-money-to-private-equity-people funds? Do they have to borrow to do so? From each other? Or what?
2. There's going to be an absolutely amazing Money Stuff when Oaktree tries to seize an Apollo managing director's house after a fund does poorly.

NOTE: THIS AXIOM IS TRUE: MAKE SURE THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO LOSE AS WELL!
