
## QIS

I have occasionally, as a writer about finance and a former equity derivatives banker, made fun of structured notes. A structured note is essentially a package sold by a bank to private wealth customers consisting of:

1. Some option or set of options on one or more stocks, indexes, commodities or what have you;
2. An unsecured bond of the bank; and
3. A big fee for the bank.

“If you want those options,” I used to think, “you should just buy the options directly; you don’t want the bank’s unsecured credit risk and you certainly don’t want to pay the fee.” But over time I have been talked out of that purist position. In fact, it is not always easy to buy the particular options in the quantity that you want, and your trading costs might be higher than the bank’s. But also, what the bank is doing in building the structured note is finding an _appealing_ collection of options, one with a good clear story, so that instead of going out and piecing together a complicated portfolio of options you just get a thing that is like “the return on the S&P 500 Index over the next year, [but it can’t go down](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/35707099.284777/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMtMDctMTkvYS1zdG9jay1mdW5kLXRoYXQtY2FuLXQtZ28tZG93bj9jbXBpZD1CQkQwNjEzMjRfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yNDA2MTMmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/60e87ce39a995a4b1a2deb96Be42ba9e5).” You are paying the fee for simplicity, for a way to very directly implement some intuitive thesis rather than mucking about in the guts of derivatives markets.

This is true more broadly: Banks market all sorts of expensive, crude, one-size-fits-all versions of complex bespoke trades that you could do yourself. If you are an expert in the business of doing them yourself, you should. But if you are even slightly a tourist in the area — even if you are an expert in doing _other_ complex bespoke trades yourself, but you want to do a quick trade in a new asset class — you might reasonably shrug and buy the crude thing that the bank is selling. The thing that the bank is _really_ selling is convenience.

> Once hostile to the copycat products being churned out by big banks, hedge funds are becoming a major driver of the boom in what are known as quantitative investment strategies, or QIS.

> These tools take popular systematic trades and typically turn them into swaps or structured notes, creating a quick and cheap way to gain exposure. They’ve long drawn fire from asset managers for being pale imitations of the sophisticated strategies they replicate, which were often developed in academia and pioneered over decades by the likes of AQR Capital Management and Dimensional Fund Advisors.

You’re paying some fees to the bank, but those fees might be lower than the cost of hiring a trader to do it yourself.
