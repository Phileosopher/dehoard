the idea of investing is to get a return
- this shouldn't be ONLY a matter of returns if you have any [ethical] issues with certain activities (e.g., [slavery], [drugs](substances), etc)
- it's better to first know what you believe morally, then invest within those domains
  - without that framework of thought, you'll likely find yourself investing in [evil] activities without realizing it

The measure of the stock market's success is not whether stock prices are rising. It's whether stock prices are right. It's harder for the market to get prices right when there is so little money on the short side.

The psychology of investors:
- sometimes herd, preferring the safety of the company of others to make independent decisions.
- too much credence to recent and high-profile news while underestimating the longer-lasting trends or less dramatic events
- (in the same way people worry about being killed in a plane crash while not paying attention to their high cholesterol)
- fooled by randomness, believing money managers who have had a few good quarters have figured out the trick of beating the market
- find losses twice as painful as they find gains pleasurable, so hold on to stocks longer than they should, believing as long as they haven't sold it, they haven't suffered any losses
- above all, overconfident, which means they trade more than they should and end up costing themselves money as a result
- (from 1991-1996 the market returned 17.9%. active investors earned just 11.4%. They would have done better had they just sat on their hands.)

The idea of the wisdom of crowds is not that a group will always give you the right answer, but that on average it will consistently come up with a better answer than any individual could provide. That's why the fact that only a fraction of investors consistently do better than the market remains the most powerful piece of evidence that the market is efficient.

The healthiest markets are those that are animated by both fear and greed at the same time. Any time you sell a stock, the person who's buying it thinks differently about the future prospects of that stock. You think it's going down, he thinks it's going up. One of you will be right, but the important thing is that it's only through the interaction of those differing attitudes that the market is able to do a good job of allocating capital.

If groups on the whole are relatively intelligent (as we know they are), there's a good chance that a stock price is actually right. Problem is that once everyone starts piggybacking on the wisdom of the group, then no one is doing anything to add to the wisdom of the group.

Lending money in a world of lenders leaves you dependent on who you lend to
- that risk should have a contingency at all times for wiriting off as bad debt

Make sure the information all your trades are on "public information"
- this information must be accessible to everyone
- the information may be your [trade-specific] expertise, but it's still something anyone else can theoretically research
- however, if it's enough money, expect lawsuits about it

the only difference between gambling and investing is [knowledge]

clarify the meaning of close-to-the-money versus out-of-the-money

index funds are safe, but they also oddly unethical
- it's bsaically holding an entire industry, meaning that the stakeholding of any individual company is not aas well-considered as the stakeholding of the mutual fund's basket

IF IT SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT MAY BE A LAUNDERING OR [MLM] SCHEME

3 TIMELESS IDEAS FOR INVESTING:
1. Look at stocks as part-ownership of a business
2. Look at market fluctuations as your friend by profiting from folly rather than participating in it.
3. Margin of safety.
It seems like a waste to get a PhD in Economics and have it all come back to that. There's a tendency to overlook anything that simple and important.
