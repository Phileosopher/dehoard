away moves: the things we do when we're trying to get away from the interpreted-as-adverse experiences

isolation
work
drinking alcohol
using drugs
watching tv
playing video games
arguing
yelling/screaming
hurting other people's feelings
self-harm
shopping
gambling
overeating/undereating
planning/organizing
oversleeping/napping
listen to music
gym

they're all moving away from unwanted things

they're not WRONG, but you have to keep asking:
Does this put my values at risk?

it helps to understand WHAT your values even are

the more we try to control others, the less we can control ourselves
the more we try to avoid uncomfortable experiences, the less we can control them

analogy:
we're all blindfolded, but with a bag of tools
there are holes everywhere
bound to fail, no matter what happens
we are then in a hole
the only tool we have is a shovel
we try to get out with the shovel
we start imagining how it's not fair we're in the hole, or how we got there
we believe someone has an answer using a shovel
we keep digging deeper and deeper
what should we do with that shovel?

the away move is the shovel
any new shovels will be the same problem

we have to claim responsibility with the situation we're in

we dig because we want control

a huge aspect of all this is pure acceptance of the thing
- not that we're doomed for the rest of our life there, but that it's an inescapable reality that we don't want to make worse
