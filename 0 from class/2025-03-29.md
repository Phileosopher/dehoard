When someone doesn't want to do speaker/listener, the wiser thing to do is to have some exit statements:
- "I don't feel safe continuing while we are currently in this mode."
- "I'm not interested in continuing while we both maintain this paradigm."
- "I don't want to discuss this when I don't feel safe."
