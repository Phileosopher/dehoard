self-toleration is important, since it gives us the freedom to unwind

feelings are either wanted or unwanted, but they're not "good" or "bad"
- they represent their quality by their utility

we are incessantly experiencing all the feelings at once
- the smaller feelings are always NOT articulated because we don't have time or energy to fully disclose
- those feelings, though, are all over the place, constantly

emotions are a full-body response
- we are physiologically reacting to the experience

only 3 acceptable emotions for men to express
- anger
- pride
- disdain
