the ontological self-first mindset is absolutely pristine for figuring out problems that exist
- they are HIGHLY good at finding out what's wrong

however, that mindset is risky because it doesn't represent solutions
- the healthy outcome doesn't represent as vividly in the focus of the problem
- it also represents things like religion as therapeutic fixes, but diminishes their value because they don't fully represent in the domain of the "known"

thus, the ACE score only indicates what is "there", but doesn't represent any answers
