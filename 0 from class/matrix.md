THE MATRIX

divide out between the internal and external world
- external - what is apparent to everyone
- internal - what we do in our minds
divide between favorable and unfavorable things

FAVORABLE INTERNAL: values - what and who we value
    who - beings we value (i.e., people, animals, God)
    what - tangible things we value
    qualities - attributes we live to stand by
        can be self-defined or defined by society
UNFAVORABLE INTERNAL: unwanted mental experiences - things we don't want
    Thoughts, emotions, urges, memories, cravings, feelings, physical sensations
    unwanted feelings: sadness, anger, fear, jealousy, shame, guilt, hopelessness, anxiety, grief
        out-of-place emotions
    self-destructive mantras
    fantasies of sin
    a vast range of our mental experiences are unwanted
UNFAVORABLE EXTERNAL aka AWAY MOVES: what we do to avoid pain

    isolation
    talk to someone
    work
