boundaries come from several motivations:
- a need for [safety]
- a desire to abide by a [value]

setting boundaries:
1. talk about the importance of the relationship
    think about your values
    ask why the relationship is important
    consider how you can communicate how important they are to you
    indicate the meaning that person is to you
2. Describe the behavior you wish to change
    be calm and respectful
    use "I" statements
    the statements must match the boundary you're setting
    it's essentially an assertion of what you are and can do
    "I feel (emotion that isn't anger) when (situation)".
3. Request that the behavior stop
    be specific!
4. Acknowledge the impact of the behavior
    avoid ultimatums or empty threats
    you have 2 choices:
        1. indicate the negative consequences THAT YOU CAN AND WILL ENFORCE if it continues
        2. indicate the positive consequences that will happen if the situation changes
